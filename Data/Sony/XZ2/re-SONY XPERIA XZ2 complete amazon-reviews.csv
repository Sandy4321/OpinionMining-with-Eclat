3.0 out of 5 stars;A mixed bag. Not a 5.7 inch screen;"This phone is a mixed bag. On paper, the specs look good and it seems to run fast. However, the biggest issue that I have with the phone is its screen. Sony claims that the phone has a 5.7 inch screen. NOT TRUE. The useable screen is only 5.3 inch. So if you are looking for a 5.3 inch screen, this may be your phone. If you need something bigger, move on.

Currently own a Samsung Note 4. It has a true 5.7 inch screen. Measuring the width and the height of the screen you get about 7.1 x 12.6 cm = 89.46 sqcm of useable screen space. My iPhone 6s plus has 83.64 sqcm of screen space. And now this Sony XZ2 : 6.5 x 11.6 cm = 75.4 sqcm of usable screen space. You loose a lot of real estate. Can't afford this, need this phone for business  to read documents, emails, etc. so I need to screen space.";M S Frank;29-Aug-18; ;phone,phone,screen,phone,screen,screen,screen,phone,screen,phone,emails,documents;1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

3.0 out of 5 stars;Marginal improvement from XZs;"Beware whom you get this phone from!!!
The more I use this phone, the more I feel that this phone was a demo unit.
- screen touch isn't responsive
- periodic lines appears when hands are warm
- auto brightness is close to not working

Updated thoughts:
I think xperia xz2 is generally a good phone. However, after seeing the complaints, it makes me wonder if third party sellers are getting their phones from defected batches from the manufacturers (not Sony). That's why they are much cheaper than the market value. I'll buy it from best buy directly to see if there are fewer issues.

New found issue:
As many people would do after the screen is full of fingerprints and dusty, we wipe it with cloth or our clothes. After that, you will see very obvious horizontal lines due to ESD. Not sure if this is my phone or it's a general issue. I have to restart the phone to get rid of the lines.
Also, if you finger swipe quickly and create some static, you will see the color gets darker... Very disappointed

Upgraded from xperia xzs...
Have been a Sony fan... However, somehow a bit disappointed by the phone. But let's start with the good stuff though:

1. Great LCD screen, good color, but light leakage is a bit worse than my xzs.
2. Good low light performance camera. However, I think they over increased the pixel gain. As a result, during normal light condition, noise is higher.
3. Battery life is improved, probably just because it's bigger.
4. Beautiful design (black) without a case
5. Speaker is louder

Now, the bad stuff:
1. Fingerprint sensor location is awkward. After upgrading to Android 9, it became less responsive and some Apps stopped working with the sensor.
2. Slippery without a case.
3. Nice haptic engine, but the force is too small to feel when there is a phone call.
4. A bit on the heavier side as for the weight.
5. Pictures from the front camera are very nosiy
6. Sony needs to make a SW to stop all the Google stuff that's running in the background. That's why the bigger battery doesn't improve the user experience that much
7. Battery care option doesn't seem to work on my phone

My wish list for xz4...
1. Don't use oled... It's the stupidest technology... Shorter life time, burn in problem... Maybe save the battery life marginally
2. Keep the fingerprint sensor on the Side!!! Under display fp sensor is overrated. People will see burn in in their oled with optical fp sensors
3. Make a better SW.
4. Have a option in the camera so that images are less noisy in normal lighting
5. If you want to do a glass back for wireless charge, use frosted glass so that it's not a fingerprint magnet or scratch-happy surface";Nick;19-Dec-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-5-7-inches-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07BGXVDZP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,phone,phone,screen,touch,auto,brightness,phone,phones,people,screen,fingerprints,phone,phone,color,phone,screen,lcd,color,performance,camera,battery,speaker,fingerprint,sensor,location,sensor,slippery,engine,phone,call,pictures,camera,battery,battery,option,phone,technology,time,battery,fingerprint,sensor,display,sensor,sensors,option,camera,images,wireless,charge;0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great international cell phone;"First off, I'm a Sony believer... But jokes aside, this is a great phone for personal or business use, I got the dual sim international version because I needed a Swiss simcard and a US simcard for my business. I used this phone in the USA and throughout Europe. And I had absolute no issues with reception or anything.

The fingerprint reader in the back was something to get used to, but after a while you'll not even know how it was before... 😃

Overall, fast, great battery life, and many of great functions...

5.0 out of 5 stars;Great smart phone with great features;By far best phone I had. I switched from apple to android and this is the first android I've had in over 7 years. Really impressed with the features it comes with and the price point, if this was an apple phone it would cost triple. I would Recommend to anyone who wants an android but doesn't want to get a Samsung or LG. Here in the states I think only 2 carriers can work with this phone AT&T for sure ( I had to switch to this carrier for this phone) and I believe the other is Verizon.;Francisco;14-Jul-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-5-7-inches-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07BGXVDZP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,features,phone,carriers,phone,phone;1,1,1,1,1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;Highest quality feel of any phone I've ever tried other than xperia xz3;High quality phone, better than any other android phone to my knowledge excluding the newly released xz3. The screen is actually really good when compared to oleds side by sude even though it's an lcd screen which was surping. The speakers are also incredible for a phone. I know this phone still has bezels but I don't mind them because I actually have a place to grip it when watching movies unlike the iphone x wich sometimes falls because I have to be careful not to touch the screen. Also the fingerprint sensor for my not so big hands is perfectly placed and I have had no problems mistaking the camera for the fingerprint sensor.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Battery Life, Good Camera, Buttery-smooth Operation, with the Usual Sprinkle of Pre-installed Crapware;"Great battery life is what I look for in every phone that I buy. This one lasts me 1.5 to 2 days on a full charge—and I usually only charge it up to 95%. The phone UI is pretty smooth. Even with battery time preferred STAMINA mode (which I keep on most of the time), the phone feels quite responsive.

I can’t say much about the camera other than that it takes pictures much better than the Xperia Z5 Compact that I have. The photos just come out with more detail. It’s not as good as SAMSUNG or Apple’s iPhone though—which is weird considering the fact that Sony makes great DSLRs and camera sensors.

A little warning for those who do not like pre-installed crapware: this phone is heavy on the Amazon pre-installed apps and Facebook which cannot be removed—only disabled. I use Amazon services, but I do not want separate apps hogging storage space on my phone. I prefer the much less intrusive option of using a web browser. Among the list of crapware that I’ve had to disable: Amazon Shopping, Amazon Kindle, AVG Protection, Facebook, Facebook App Installer, Facebook App Manager, Facebook Services, Lounge, and Prime Video. At least they removed File Commander and Spotify (which were pre-installed on previous phones).";Kevin L.;13-Jun-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-5-7-inches-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07BGXVDZP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;battery,phone,charge,phone,ui,battery,time,stamina,mode,time,phone,camera,pictures,photos,camera,sensors,warning,phone,services,apps,storage,space,phone,option,web,browser,app,services,video,file,phones;1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
5.0 out of 5 stars;A unique flagship phone doesn't cost you that much.;I initially bought this phone for it 960 fps fhd slowmo camera. After using it for six month , I found out it is a great smart phone for 500 dollars. It has a good battery ,a nice screen with good color accuracy, and a strong sp845 processing power.

5.0 out of 5 stars;The first truly awesome Sony smartphone;"This is my fifth Sony. Literally all other Androids offend my sense of style, they are just fuckly. So I always ended up getting Sonys for their black, clean, angular lines and that awesome side-mounted fingerprint sensor. However, I did so knowing full well that they were technologically mediocre compared to Samsung and some other brands. However, I just hate Samsungs styling and they way they rape Android.

With the XZ2 things changed. I was, and still am, a little disappointed that Sony dropped the side-mounted fingerprint sensor. But except for that, this phone is excellent. The screen is great, it is super fast and smooth. Great camera. Battery is miles better than on any previous model. Last but not least, it looks fantastic (people actually peek at it wondering what it is) and it also feels great to hold.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Great phone with outstanding camera;"Great phone. I have it since a couple of months and I will buy another one for my wife. The camera is the most important feature on a smartphone for me and in this point it is probably the best device on the market right now.
I compared photos from the same scene from an iPhone X and a S9+ and the Sony brings higher resolution and better colors even in low light conditions.
What also convinced me was the display, which beats Apple and Samsung in max. brightness. It's not an OLED display which means less contrast and a noticeable black level but it has a higher color fidelity and more natural colors, which I find more important (personal opinion).

On the negative side it is a little thicker and heavier than the competitors.

The build quality of the phone is great and it feels very solid. Some people complain about the location of the finger print reader, which I can't understand. I have no problems finding it and it works great.

All in all the flagship phones are all very close together and the decision to choose one over the other is down to details. I had Sony and Samsung phones before. Here the decision was for the camera and that the Sony phones I had so far were a little more stable in software and survived very long even so I don't treat my phones very carefully.";xSTONE;29-Jul-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-5-7-inches-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07BGXVDZP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,camera,feature,smartphone,device,photos,scene,resolution,colors,display,brightness,display,color,fidelity,colors,phone,location,reader,print,phones,phones,camera,phones,software,phones;1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

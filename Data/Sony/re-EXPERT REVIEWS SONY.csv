5.0 out of 5 stars;"Washer safe ;)";So it's the cleanest phone I've ever used... literally, just sent it through my washer machine... On accident of course. I thought it sounded weird that there would be something banging in my washer so I open it saw my phone was able to use it right away. Besides that the phone is great fast and responsive. Plays games well, doesn't get hot. The battery care system is nice. The finger print scanner works very well.;Tommyj13;17-Nov-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,phone,phone,battery;2,2,1,2

4.0 out of 5 stars;Will NOT work on CDMA/Verizon 3rd party networks!;"I spent about a week trying to figure out why my phone would not receive texts at all, while every other feature worked perfectly. When I finally contacted Sony, they told me that this phone does NOT have the capability to work on 3rd party Verizon networks (MVNOs) (like net10, Red Pocket, StraightTalk, etc) on a CDMA SIM card. If you are using Verizon itself it WILL work though, you just have to have a certain setting enabled for your coverage. AT&T  and its equivalent MVNO works just fine (so I have been told- still waiting for my SIM card to come in). Wish someone had told me about that before, it would have saved me a lot of time and frustration. I was also told by Sony that this is the ONLY Sony phone that will work on Verizon. All the other ones do not have the capability.

Another complaint I have is that it will not connect to my wi-fi extender. It is fine with the ""regular"" wifi, but it just will not connect to the extension no matter what I try. Seems like Sony has a few features that they need to add/update.

The phone itself is nice- has a lot of great features and I love the size. The pictures are crystal clear and the sound quality is great. Hoping my choice to stick with the phone and forefit my preferred coverage is worth it!";Melanie DiBona;23-Oct-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,phone,verizon,network,verizon,sony,phone,sony,phone,feature,size,picture,sound,quality,phone;0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,2
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great performance, battery, and size;"Pros-
Fantastic battery for the size.  Routinely finish the day with 40% after a few hours of streaming music/video and light gaming.
Top notch performance.  Same CPU/RAM as the Pixel 3 but almost half the price.
Camera is a big step up from previous Motorola.  Not as fast/clear as the iPhone or Pixel but dedicated camera button is great and most photos don't need correcting on Auto.  960 FPS slow mo is a great party trick but needs so much light it gets lots of image noise if used indoors.
Cons-
No headphone jack.  Type C dongles are fiddly at best and makes you paranoid that you'll damage the charge port if your headphones pull to hard.
Sony's UI overlay isn't too intrusive but the settings menu is hard to navigate.  Had to search for things like 3rd party app installation.
Comes with Swiftkey preinstalled.  Normally a good thing but GBoard has improved so much it's much more intuitive for things like voice texting.";DrMario86;29-Nov-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;battery,performance,price,camera,button,camera,photo,headphone,headphone;1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,2
4.0 out of 5 stars;Compact size with a decent performance;"Though the performance is not as high as other flagship phones, This phone's unique feature that any other phones don't have is the compact size with sufficient performance. Because of the small size of screen and body, there are actually some inconvenient things, like a little annoying camera button or a difficult play with ""PS4 Remote Play"".

So, if you want to buy a MODERN and SMALL smartphone and usually don't enjoy some video related entertainments,  I'll bet Xperia XZ2 Compact is the best smartphone for you.";Minsu Kang;19-Dec-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;performance,phone,phone,phone,size,performance,size,screen,body,camera,button;0,2,1,1,2,2,2,2,0,0,0

5.0 out of 5 stars;Survived 36 hours in salt water on vacation!;"Hawaii Day 1- went snorkeling with my 4 year old Sony Xperia Z2.  The waterproof gaskets for the charge port door had long since worn out so it flooded and died.  That phone was a tank and I put it through hell non-stop for 4 years traveling and living in Alaska for most of it.  It still worked flawlessly until I drowned it.
Later that day I went to a local blue and yellow electronics store and a Samsung sales rep approached me and asked what I was looking for in a phone.  I told him I'm looking for one that says Sony on it.  Walked out with an XZ2 Compact.  Out of the thousands of times I dropped my last Sony Z2, about half were due to trying to reach my thumb across the screen and the XZ2 was even bigger.  The XZ2 compact is about perfect size for me.  Reminds me of my first smartphone, the Xperia X10.
The next morning, 12 hours after purchase I absent-mindedly pocketed my brand new XZ2 compact and went back in the ocean in front of my hotel.  Hours later I realized it was gone and concluded it must have gone back in my pocket and slipped out while snorkeling.  Devastating. I snorkeled for another hour trying to find it and gave up.
A day and a half later, I find out someone found it!!  It was still on!!  5pm the next day. No case or anything.
 They stepped on it in about 5ft (neck deep) of water where it was too cloudy to see the bottom.  It still had 47% battery.  The guy that found it was so impressed he took a picture of the model number and wants to buy one.

I'm so glad I was able to find a Sony phone at a local store, I've always had good luck with Xperia phones but this wins all my torture stories.

I'm still adjusting to typing on the smaller screen but everything else has been a painless transition.  My two only complaints (and I'm a non-stop complainer/nit-picker) is the lack of headphone port and I wish the brightness slider had a toggle for auto brightness without going into the settings.

It's a bit thick but after a few minutes in your hand it's the perfect shape and I prefer it now.  It feels indestructable but small and sleek.  It's also extremely slippery without a case.  Even worse than having a glass back like the regular XZ2 has so I'll be buying a slim case if I can manage not to lose it by the end of my trip!";Ben N.;30-Sep-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,sony,screen,size,picture,shape,case,case,glass;0,2,2,1,1,1,0,2,0

5.0 out of 5 stars;Just like the Z3v, but faster and smoother;"So far, absolutely incredible phone. SMS and MMS along with calls will not work on verizon until you activate HD voice on your account. I activated this through the my verizon app, and was up and running immediately.

The compact is a minor adjustment for me, as I upgraded from the Xperia Z3v, and the smaller phone is not ideal to type on with my obnoxiously large fingers. I think with a little re-training it won't be much of an issue.

If you're one of the remaining Z3v users left like I was that didn't want to give up your Sony for one of the major brands, this is definitely a seamless transition.";Pyro;27-Jul-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,verizon,phone;1,2,0
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Small Phone!;I've been looking for a phone to replace my Samsung S4. This phone is perfect for me. I have ATT as my provider, and I could never find a small phone through their stores. I read lots of reviews and decided to take a chance ordering it through Amazon sight unseen. The only issue I had was that my SIM card was too big for this phone. I took it in to ATT and they replaced the Sim for $5. They also showed me how to move my contacts with ATT mobile, but I used the Xperia Transfer App, and it moved info with no problems. I'm still learning all the features, but I already know I love the fingerprint unlocking and the camera button.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Amazing Phone;"This is my favorite phone of all time. Incredibly fast hardware, excellent and sturdy build quality, fantastic shape for one-handed use, great audio, and the Sony UI is lightweight and snappy. I switched to this from a Galaxy Note and I don't miss the bigger screen at all.

This phone won't work with Sprint, so I took it to a Verizon store and made the switch. We had some trouble getting the phone to work at first (couldn't make calls) -- but the solution was to have them enable HD Voice on my Verizon account (no extra charge).";Amazon Customer;16-Jun-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,sony,screen,phone,verizon,phone;1,1,1,2,2,2
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best phone I've bought in a long long time;As a huge techie I've been jumping from Android to Android for that last several years looking for a phone that did not compromise.  After my pixel 1 died I decided to go for this awesome gem after seeing multiple reviews.  I could not be happier.  After several months my battery life still lasts over a day, the pictures are beautiful (not as awesome as a pixel, but not bad by any means) and fast and snappy.  I don't know why don't doesn't market or advertise their phones in America but they should.  The smaller size of the compact hits the hand in all the right places and makes one handed operation a breeze.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Stellar and Right-Sized Smartphone;"This phone has exceeded my high expectations.  This is my second Sony Xperia (had Z3 for 4 years, which I found an amazing phone), and am glad I stuck with it.  There is definitely a simple/clean/sleek theme to my preferences (Volvo, ASUS, Ecco, etc), and that might put into context my appreciation of the Sony Xperia series.

Perfect size and weight for my purposes, solid build, demonstrably waterproof, crisp and sharp display, lightning-fast processor, great camera (I prefer using SLR for anything important), cleanly moderate features and installed apps, and nearly everything is customizable (e.g. you can remove nearly every icon at the top).

I personally do not mind the move to remove the audio jack, as I understand why, and the lack of T-Mobile Voice-over-WiFi or Voice over LTE an issue -- that feature seemed less clear than standard cellular connection anyway.

Also, after hearing concerns with the US-model, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the fingerprint reader works, and flawlessly.  And I personally like the placement just fine, works well with how I hold it, either hand.

Bottom line:  My household has had 6+ iPhones, a Samsung Galaxy, a Motorola, and 2 Sony Xperias.  I would call this Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact my favorite of all time, while my family members would probably say it ties with the current iPhone.";W.e.W;2-Aug-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,sony,phone,sony,processor,camera,feature,jack,connection,fingerprint,sony,xperia,sony;2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,2,2
1.0 out of 5 stars;Can’t get to work on Verizon/Phone is not at all what is promised;Despite reviews saying otherwise and it supposedly being certified on Verizon, I had a lot of problems with this phone. I could call and send texts but couldn’t receive them. Spent hours on the phone with Verizon, still couldn’t get it to work. Sony’s customer service is complete joke, so don’t even bother. On top of that, the phone kept telling me it needed a system update, so I’d install it and then it would tell me to restart the phone, so I’d restart it, but then it’d tell me I still needed to install the update. Went through this process four times and on the fifth attempt at installing the update I gave up. Also very strange looking and grainy photos for camera that is supposedly 19 mp. Also at first i thought I’d like the fingerprint scanner on the back but when you’re driving and you have the phone in a holder, the position makes it very awkward to unlock it. I really wanted to like this phone because the size is so perfect, but ultimately this phone was a huge let down.;Walter Huxley;8-May-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,phone,phone,phone,phone,size,phone;0,1,2,2,1,1,2
4.0 out of 5 stars;Best small phone, no headphones jack, great display, surprisingly fast updates by Sony, a bit pricey.;"Ultimately, how one rates this phone depends very much on the answer to one question: how badly do you want a top of the line compact phone? If you must have the best small phone, look no further. Otherwise, read on and see if this is the phone for you.

This phone works on Verizon, as well as AT&T and T-Mobile. It does not work with Sprint. According to what I can find online, it should be fully compatible with most LTE networks in Asia and Europe, with exceptions being Japan (partial compatibility) but I won't be able to test this till later this year. It only supports 1 SIM (despite Sony's official page claiming dual SIM).

Many people compare this phone with the Pixel 2, but this phone is actually smaller (but thicker). While both have 5"" screens, the Sony not only has smaller bezels, it also has a 18:9 form factor (and yes, that's 2:1). As a result, the phone is noticeably smaller - and has about 6% less screen area. Compared to a 16:9 ratio screen, it's actually very close in width to a 4.5"" screen. In fact, it is quite close in size to a Nexus Galaxy from years ago. I'd forgotten how nice a small phone fits into my hands. It is also quite thick, significantly thicker than the Pixel 2.

With the latest Snapdragon 845 SoC, this phone has performance comparable to the latest flagships from other manufacturers such as the Samsung Galaxy S9 and OnePlus 6. The Pixel 2 has the 835 from last generation - still a decent performer. It has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. You can also add a microSD card of up to 400GB to store photos, videos, and media files.

Let's start with what it does NOT have compared to other top of the line phones.

First, and most distressing, it does not have a 3.5mm headphones jack. This is the first phone I've used that lacks it, and I'm quite unhappy about it. Sure, a dongle is included, but it is one extra item to lose, and you cannot charge while listening at the same time (Sony sells an adapter that supposedly can do that, but I can't find it for sale anywhere, and it only supports slow charging).

Next, the back is plastic. It actually feels quite nice and doesn't come across as cheap, but I was surprised.

It also lacks an OLED screen for the deep blacks. Having a couple of OLED screens with burn-in issues, I don't necessarily think of this as a disadvantage. The screen has great colors and is more than bright enough to use in full sun.

The camera is quite good, but does not have dual lens with telephoto, and doe not have OIS.

Finally, it lacks wireless charging. This is quite puzzling considering that the back is plastic. I guess Sony doesn't want to sacrifice battery capacity or make the phone even thicker in order to add wireless charging.

It does have: dust and water resistance of IP65/68, Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 (with AC adapter included), 1080p resolution display, and a whole array of other features that you expect in phones of this class so I won't bore you by listing them.

In use, the phone is extremely responsive and there's no lag whatsoever. It performs very well running games as well. Pokemon Go runs about as well as can be expected. GPS appears to be as accurate as can be expected. Sony's skin is fairly close to stock Android. The most glaring difference is the app drawer. Instead of a continuous list that scrolls from top down, you have a number of pages that you go through from left to right. Sony appears to push updates very quickly. I was pleasantly surprised to get the June security patch in the first half of June, way before my other phones (including the Xiaomi Mi A1, an Android One phone).

Ergonomically, the phone fits in my hand VERY comfortably. It seems to be designed for holding in the right hand, with all the buttons on the right side of the phone (volume, power, and camera). It would be nicer if the fingerprint sensor is positioned higher, but it's not too bad. It takes less than a second for the fingerprint sensor to recognize my fingerprint, and it appears to work very well. My OnePlus 3T's fingerprint sensor seems to work slightly faster, but this is no slouch.

One quirk that I don't like with this phone is that when you open the SIM + microSD drawer (just pull it out with your fingernails, no need for special tools or a straightened paper clip), the phone reboots. While most people probably don't change SIM cards all that often, this makes it inconvenient to swap out the microSD card.

The built in speakers are not bad, above average for a phone, but you can only get so much performance out of such tiny speakers. The camera is pretty good (but lacks optical stabilization). I'm not going to go into great depths here, but the photos are almost as good as a Pixel 2 under most situations.

The phone comes with a fair amount of bloatware that can be disabled but not uninstalled completely. These include a suite of Amazon apps, Sony's software, and AVG Antivirus. Out of 64GB of storage, about 44GB is free.

In conclusion, how you like this phone ultimately comes down to size. If you really want a small phone, this one has very few compromises. You can get better specs (except for water and dust resistance) with something like a OnePlus 6, but it's significantly larger. I'd give it 5 stars if only it came with a headphones jack.";Lenny;19-Jun-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,phone,phone,phone,phone,phone,phone,performance,photo,video,phone,sony,camera,battery,phone,phone,phone,sony,phone,phone,fingerprint,fingerprint,fingerprint,fingerprint,phone,speaker,phone,performance,camera,sony,phone,size,headphone;2,2,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,0,2,0,1,2,2,2,2

4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice size. Wish It Was A Tad Thinner And Lighter;I do like this phone and the green color. It is a slightly darker green than what I saw in the pics. But that's ok. Green is my favorite color. I bought a case for the phone not only to protect it but because the phone is very slippery and easy slides about in my large hands. It was always on my mind that the phone would slide out of my fingers and onto the floor. But the case I bought solved that problem. I really like the dedicated camera button. The camera comes on in an instant just by me feeling for the button. No more focusing on the screen and finding the camera button to touch. The power button is below the volume button and easy enough to find and get used to. I've read some reviews make a comment that the finger print reader is positioned more towards the middle of the back on the phone. I found that no big deal. I'm not a phone reviewer and found it easy enough to get used to. Plus a case make it easier to find the sensor. It is a heavier and thicker little phone. I guess if there is anything I don't care for it's that. I'd give this phone 5 stars if it was thinner and lighter. Speakers sound great.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Best phone I have had in years!;This is the best phone I have had since the Samsung alius 2! Brand new I was getting  three days of use per charge! After getting some apps that has decreased to about 2.5 days. I live in a deadzone I don't get much signal. That would sap my previous phone dry. This phone seems unaffected. In better areas with better signal I imagine the battery life to be better. The fingerprint reader works perfectly and the entire phone is customizable down to the keyboard. The glass is more durable than the frame. I dropped it on its face without a case onto wet concrete from about 3 feet twice and the screen is still perfect... No I was not doing a review video. There is sadly no headphone jack but it's not really needed and helps to further waterproof the phone. Comes with a headphone jack adapter and a terrible pair of headphones. The charging port is USB-c while the port doesn't seem to be as sturdy as I like it has proven stronger than the headphone jack the dozen or so times I have accidentally yanked out my headphones.

3.0 out of 5 stars;Verizon Users: Turn on HD Voice via MyVerizon Webapp.;"For verizon users: Make sure you have HD Voice activated. You do this via your account online. For whatever reason my phone was not receiving texts or calls. Adding HD voice (free Verizon service) fixed it.

The rest of this is some barely thought out first impressions. The former was the only important thing I came here to say since Verizon chat support was useless and I fixed the problem myself.

Gut reaction is damn its heavy and I like the size of my Nexus 5X more. A lot of content was already slightly too small on the nexus screen. The phone just seems bulky(width and weight). That being said I can reach everything on this device one handed without stretching. That is big! or small.. whatever..

YAY microSD cards! Stop pushing me into the cloud!

Boo no headphone jack. I know they make IP68 rated phone jacks, lazy designers. lol. They box should have come with a dongle that has type C and headphone connections. For now I am getting around the issue by using a blue tooth receiver for my good headphones.

It is frustrating that the LED flashlight is very dim, borderline useless, and there are no settings to fix it. It requires a new flashlight app. I get that it is a built in safety feature so it doesn't overheat the phone but it is so dim and useless. The only good scenario I see is if you're at a restaurant and don't want to blind people while you try and look at the menu up close.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Better than big dogs;"I have been a loyal Samsung phone person since the S3. I have had 2 S models, 2 different Actives and 2 different Notes, the most recent the Note 8.  Two things bothered me about the Samsung.  First the battery life kept getting shorter and second, the Samsung Software that was all over the phone.

I made the decision to go to a smaller phone and the Sony Experia XZ2 Compact was the smallest flagship I could find.  This phone addressed both my Samsung complaints.  First of all the battery life is far and above better than Samsung.  I think this is because of the combination of the smaller screen size and fewer apps running in the background.  I am a heavier user and I still only run down to 40% by the end of the day.

Second is the android experience.  This is much more like the Nexus phone I had a few years ago.  It doesn't have Bixby or Samsung cloud and other apps running in the background.  It lets you use what you want and doesn't force anything else on the user.

The fact that this phone is a 5"" model makes it pocket friendly but the screen is large enough to be functional.  It was only a few years ago that this was the standard size before the Phablets took over.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Totally disappointed. Phone calls go straight to voicemail, Would make a  good iPod iTouch;"Whenever we try to call this phone it goes straight to voicemail. Before anyone says its our Tmobile service take this into consideration. We have 7 phones on our plan (5 android & 2 IOS). All work great except this one. After trying numerous settings and resetting the phone we did find a fix, well kind of. After reading numerous blogs of folks having the exact same issue; apparently the fix is to restart the phone. So whenever we call our son and it goes straight to voicemail, we have locate someone else near him to tell him to restart his phone. It does work for a little bit after the restart and then goes back to doing the exact same thing. Sorry, that’s not a fix for me. Hopefully not to late to return it, but we gave been messing with this phone for 30 days trying to make it work. I do not believe it’s the provider since it’s the only phone, out of 7, that has issues. Will stay away from this and other Sony phones in the future. Totally disappointed.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Finally a worthy “flagship” competitor, in a (very) compact size;"Ever since the very first Android HTC “smart phone” several years ago, I’ve owned more phones than I can recall. Including several from Samsung, Sony, LG, Nokia, OnePlus, Essential, and others. I’m rather familiar with smartphones. :) So let’s take that experience and see how the latest from Sony performs compared to the world of smartphones. In particular, against my current daily driver, the Galaxy S8+.

+ Standard 64GB Internal Storage
+ Fantastic 5” 1080p HDR LCD Display (18:9)
+ No Notch!
+ Solid Battery Life
+ Fast Charge Capable via USB-C (3.0)
+ Forward Facing Stereo Speakers!
+ Great 19MP Front camera with crisp/sharp images
+ Fingerprint reader (finally!)
+ Virtually all LTE bands supported (GSM & CDMA)

- Camera app can be buggy at times
- List price a bit high

DESIGN

The Xperia XZ2 Compact is a 5” phone with some updated, yet familiar Sony design aesthetics. Featuring squarish corners with a slight curve at the edges of the glass screen (2D) to make holding/swiping more comfortable. Otherwise it’s a mostly flat screen.

First important note is that they have now moved to a 18:9 aspect ratio display, along with the majority of 2018 phones. As such, the phone looks and feels smaller than a 5” 16:9 aspect ratio phone. This can be good or bad depending on preference. For example, I’ve already noticed the keyboard is more cramped and overall feels tiny compared to every other phone I have. It’s certainly more than usable. If you’re going for a compact phone in the first place, you probably won’t mind.

The backing is plastic, but doesn’t feel cheap, and does an good job of resisting fingerprints. Beyond that, there is a USB-C port at the bottom and volume/power/camera button, all on the right. And missing from many recent US Sony phones, there is finally rear-mounted fingerprint reader.

The single Nano-SIM and MicroSD tray is on the left. As an added bonus, you can actually remove it with your finger nails. On the front you have a very useful notification LED. As well as my favorite feature, front facing stereo speakers. As with most Sony phones, they have a good high-end quality appearance and feel. But lean towards a more understated look. Nothing too flashy, in particular in black.

As is common these days, the battery is not removable. It’s 2018, so no surprise there. But I will continue to miss that particular feature.

OS & FEATURES

Having owned Sony phones and tablets before, everything feels very familiar. If you’ve recently used a stock android phone, everything is generally where it should be. Minor changes include the app drawer, which slides left/right, and there are Sony tweaks hidden throughout. I keep finding nice touches here and there as I explore the UI.

One noteworthy feature is the addition of Themes, which are accessible with the Widgets & Wallpaper settings. Sony has their STAMINA mode which adds considerable battery life to the phone. It’s similar to what Google started adding since Marshmallow in that it disables extra functionality and features to really stretch out runtime. Most manufactures have some variant of this where it suspends inactive apps, unless you exclude them. As in those cases, be sure to “exclude” app you don’t want put to sleep (i.e. chat or messaging apps).

Sadly, there is a bit of bloatware in the form of Sony & few 3rd party apps, which you generally can’t remove. For those you can disable/hide, it’s easy enough to pretend they aren’t there. I just wish you could remove them all. Or not there to begin with.

While I’m a big fan of 100% stock Android and faster updates, I’ll gladly take the extras if basic performance & functionality doesn’t take a hit. Which is exactly the case here. There's enough usable and practical features that I like to make it worth it.

At the time of this review, we’re on Android 8.0.0 and Sony Build 51.1.A.4.173.

PERFORMANCE

Stutter and lag are some of the most annoying things in a phone. I’ve sold phones for this reason in the past. As noted in the OS section above, the user interface runs great. Unlike some manufactures, Sony generally gives you just about all of the “flagship” specs on the small phones, just as they do with the larger ones. So we’ve got a Snapdragon 845 with 4GB of RAM. Everything is smooth, fast, and no signs of stutter or lag.

Gaming is always a good example of real-world performance. It’s the primary task most folks are going to do that really pushes the chipset. I played several games including SimCity, Anomaly KR, Asphalt 8, and many others. They all ran perfectly fine. It helps that we’re only needing to push 1080p.

If pushed hard, the phone does get a bit warm. In particular when going through the initial setup, downloading a bunch of apps, etc. That seems to be the norm with the latest high-end chips. Most of the time it’s rather cool.

DISPLAY

After having used so many OLED displays, it’s often difficult going back to a “normal” IPS LCD. However, the 5” 1080p “HDR” Display on the XZ2 looks excellent. In fact, right next to my OLED S8+ it more than holds it own. Solid black levels (if not quite OLED), sharp images, great viewing angles, no light bleed, etc. Colors can appear a tad over saturated at the higher brightness levels, but there are display adjustments for that. Honestly, it’s just a nice screen to look at it.

With many cheaper IPS panels, you really do notice lesser screen quality and poor black levels compared to the newer IPS/OLED displays. Not so here. Yes, even with “only” 1080p resolution. On this 5” panel, nobody is going to miss those pixels unless you have it right in front of you face. Sony has always been commended and known for good quality IPS panels, and they continue to raise the bar. Default color temp leans toward the cool side. You can easily adjust this to your preference.

Auto-brightness has improved over the years to the point where it’s useful. Adapting to your lighting condition and remembering your preference for different scenarios.

CAMERA

Sony has always been known for making excellent cameras sensors that other manufactures use. Even though historically, the overall camera solution has been hit or miss on their own phones. Usually blamed on the software side of things. The 19MP front and 5MP rear camera are notable improvements over Sony phones in the past.

The Sony Camera app itself really hasn't changed in quite a while. The app itself could use an update to be slightly more intuitive and user friendly. I won’t go into all of the extra camera features. If you’ve used a modern smartphone, it's got those features, plus a few fun Sony add-on's to keep things interesting. Including a separate AR app that adds special effects and themes to your pictures and a new 3D Modeling feature. Other than the occasional panoramic shot, most of us are going to stick with automatic.

Which I compared in multiple side-by-side pictures from my other phones. I did find in certain situations the image looked a tad over processed. Most noticeable on zoom. In moderate to good lighting, the 19MP camera really shines. With natural colors, crisp image, and well balanced contrast. Although most descent cameras do well here.

The biggest difference is with low-light. Where Sony is forced to increase ISO the point of grainy images, but does at least capture the shot so it's brighter. Samsung is able to have a smoother “post ready” picture. Even though it was darker and had less detail. In either case, it’s all better thanks to the external camera button that’s always there, ready to open the camera app, quickly focus, and take that quick shot.

Unless you demand the best camera out there for 2018, I think this will suit the majority of users, producing good overall images, in the majority of situations. Not to mention putting older cameras to shame.

VIDEO

As you’d expect in this class, we have 4K video recording. Which looks good and is easily on-par with the Galaxy S8. There is HDR video recording that is rather unique to the XZ2 at this time. Although in my experience I found that it tended to produce a less vivid picture. But there was better detail. Your mileage will vary. One time recording with HDR resulted in audio, but no video. This only became apparent when viewing later and I haven't been able to reproduce that yet.

There is also slow motion video capture, 120fps or 960fps. For 960fps, you just start recording video as you normally would. When ready to capture slow motion, hit the record button at just the right moment. Not the best or worst implementation. As you need to hit a button, which only captures 3 seconds at a time. It still works quite well for on-going action scenes; although you’ll want to have plenty of light and the resolution is still rather poor. It's basically useless in low or moderate light.

Recording with 120fps was much easier to use, as you can simply record as normal. Then after you're done, select what portion of the video you want to be saved in slow motion. It also records audio, in slow motion. Which can create a fun and interesting effect. The video quality is noticeable better than at 960fps.

It's also wort noting that on two separate occasions the camera app generated an error. Requiring me to exit, manually close, and re-open. That hasn't happened again in the past week, but hopefully something fixed via update.

BATTERY

This is one of those features that seems to be at the bottom of the list for phone manufactures who are more interested in making phones as thin as physically possible. However, the relatively large 2870 mAh battery combined with the power efficient 845 chipset, software improvements, and 1080p display means you’ll likely get better than average battery life, as I did.

In my use, I was seeing 5+ hours screen-on time, and could easily last an entire day with moderate usage. That’s a little over half brightness, watching videos, surfing, a game here and there, all radios enabled, etc. Your mileage will absolutely vary. As with most phones, if you decide to really push it, such as high brightness, lots of screen-on time, and high-end games running, you’ll still be looking for a charger by dinner time.

As expected, you do have fast charging at your disposal via Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0. I just prefer to avoid the cord until bedtime. Less aggressive users should do just fine, however. Even I was using the phone much more than usual to stress test and see how the battery fares. The relatively smaller screen size combined with fewer pixels to push do help a lot.

Sadly there is no wireless charging. For that, you’ll need to move up to the non-compact variant.

SOUND

There are two speakers, and they’re on the front. You know, right where they should be. Fortunately, Sony continues to avoid common industry trends to shove speakers on the back/bottom where they are easily blocked. This placement is perfect for watching youtube and playing games.

With that said, the speakers could sound better. Even though total volume isn’t an issue, it can sound a bit tiny, and doesn’t have as much depth as I would like. At least you’ve got good stereo separation and still sounds decent. I’ll take this over a higher quality bottom-firing speaker any day.

NETWORK/CARRIER USAGE

I have AT&T and T-Mobile SIMs which are used in many other phones I have laying around. As in typical Sony fashion, these phones are factory unlocked and have virtually all of the LTE bands you could want for a GSM or CDMA carrier. That covers just about anybody in the US.

Supporting all of the latest and greatest bands is key in ensuring you’ve got full coverage for your carrier, regardless of geographical location. Meaning I’ve got lots of bars and excellent transfer rates for both carriers; right on par with my other carrier branded devices. Unfortunately we only have single nano-SIM + MicroSD. No Dual SIM option. Another feature left for the non-compact XZ2.

Wi-Fi has been a weak point in past Sony phones, which appear to be improved, if not entirely resolved. At least for me. I compared side-by-side with the S8 and it was within a few percentage points for speed and signal strength. Very nice. Although at range, with 5G, the Sony would frequently lose signal several feet before my Samsung did.

VOICE QUALITY

I know it’s shocking, but I still use my phone for voice calls rather often. Both for work and personal. Using the earpiece and bluetooth works perfectly fine. I paired with multiple wireless devices, vehicles, headsets, etc. No issues at all. Calls came in loud and clear.

Using the speakerphone functionality was somewhat of a lower point as the other party sound tiny. Something carried over from general speaker quality noted above. It’s still perfectly usable and the other party had no problem hearing me as long as I didn’t venture too far away from the phone.

FINGERPRINT READER

Historically US Sony phones haven’t had a fingerprint reader. But it’s finally here on the XZ2, right on the back. Since this is a small phone, it’s almost at the center, and not far from the camera. It’s also very flat with the back surface. You see where this is going.

It will take some getting used to. Not only to find it, but to avoid smudging the camera lens. Easy solution; get a case. I’ve got one and it immediately resolved the problem for me. Otherwise the reader itself is super fast and response. Works great.

CONCLUSION

The small size might be the only thing that keeps me from using this is a long-term daily driver. I’ve used 5” phones before, but the 18:9 aspect ratio may be just a bit “too small” for daily use. Most manufactures have increased the overall size of their small and large phones to compensate for the effect a narrow aspect ratio has.

And the other cons? Well, let’s face it, they’re few and relatively minor. We only have single SIM and no wireless charging. Aside from this, it’s got everything a flagship needs. I'm also not 100% impressed with the camera app, given the glitches I've run into. I'll continue to use for a few more weeks and update the review as needed. Once evaluation is done, it will likely become my #2 phone (mostly due to size), which joins many other phones I keep around. I use various phones for different purposes.

Overall, if you can find it below list price, I consider this phone recommended for those in the market for a very compact high-end android smartphone that can pretty much do it all. In fact, I'm planning on getting the larger XZ2 or Premium, when it's released, as my daily driver. It's that good. 4.4 stars.";Wayne;8-Jun-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,sony,sony,camera,button,storage,storage,display,battery,speaker,camera,build,button,sony,camera,design,phone,sony,design,phone,phone,phone,button,sony,phone,fingerprint,feature,speaker,sony,phone,quality,phone,phone,case,sony,performance,case,time,sony,performance,phone,phone,manufacture,sony,performance,chip,display,quality,camera,camera,camera,battery,battery,display,battery,camera;1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,1

The display is super crisp, it has good sound (I tend to use a phone for watching movies way more than I should, so audio level is key), and it is blazing fast. The camera takes great pictures, and the OS is very easy to learn and navigate. I've spent most of my smartphone life with an iphone, so I was happy to find that using the OS on this Xperia is not all that much different.

The phone itself is fairly compact, but has a nice heft to it that gives it a very substantial feel that is missing from many phones.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Phone Bricked After 40 Days - NIGHTMARE Warranty Process;"As an Amazon customer since 2007, I have never once written a review of a product, positive or negative.  I am obliged to compose this review in excruciating detail, however, as this phone had a manufacturer's defect and Sony Xperia Support has subsequently given me the run-around for nearly two months throughout the warranty repair process.

After using this phone for just 40 days, the device unexpectedly bricked during routine use.  The product comes with a 1-year manufacturer's warranty, and after multiple rounds of back-and-forth troubleshooting with customer service, I was issued a shipping label to return it to Sony's repair center in Woodbridge, IL.

The repair process estimated to take 14 business days.  After this window had elapsed and I had not been given an update on my repair status, I contacted Sony Xperia Support to learn that the repair had not yet been initiated.  I was then told it would take another week.  Xperia Support apologized for the delay and said they would treat this case as if it were their own phone.  At this point, the repair center had been in possession of my phone for 24 days.  I was also informed that the phone was indeed deemed to have malfunctioned through no fault of my own, and was completely covered under their 1-year warranty.

Over the next two weeks, I requested updates on the status of my repair.  No updates were provided from Xperia Support.  Finally, 35 days after the repair center received my phone, I was told the repair was complete.  Three days later I was informed that I would be receiving it that week.  Six days after that I had neither received the phone nor been given an update on the shipping status.  That was Day 44.  Two days later I was told that that while their system showed my repair had been complete, my phone had actually been sent to a different repair facility in Canada and that they could not contact them directly for an update.

Nearly every time I have corresponded with Xperia Support (now 11 different email/phone conversations), they have informed me that they cannot provide me with an update due to their lack of direct communication with their repair facilities.  If true, this seems to be a gross oversight in Sony's internal process.

Xperia Support is either: A). Lying to me about the process, the timing, and the nature of the device repair, or B). Actually has no means of directly contacting their repair facilities for status updates on customers' devices.  I am not sure which one is a worse look for Sony.

Sony has been in possession of my Xperia XZ2 Compact for 46 days and can provide no information on why the repair process has been so delayed nor when I should expect it to be returned to me.  I have been continuously ignored, lied to, and brushed aside by Xperia Support staff.  After asking for a different refurbished device to be sent to me in lieu of my own delayed phone, I was told that such a process would take even longer, if they even offered such an arrangement (which they decidedly do not).  I was scoffed at for even suggesting such a basic customer service solution.

Had this process gone smoothly, I would have been inclined to recommend this product to friends, family, and colleagues and to continue to purchase Sony products in the future.  However, I have never felt so poorly treated by any company, and am now inclined to warn about the abject horrors of this product and its warranty repair process.  Their repair facility has had my phone longer than I did before it inexplicably ceased to function (again, through an admitted manufacturer's defect).  Sony Xperia Support has provided the worst possible customer service experience I could have imagined for such a large and well-established company.

I spent weeks painstakingly researching this phone before deciding to purchase it, and the phone itself was excellent for the first 40 days.  I would not wish this warranty nightmare on my worst enemy, however, and will be advising everyone I know to avoid Sony's products at all costs.";Tom Anderson;29-Apr-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,sony,warranty,warranty,service,support,support,phone,phone,phone,support,sony,support,sony,sony,phone,sony,warranty,support,phone,phone;2,2,2,2,0,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,1

1.0 out of 5 stars;Fatal flaws;I feel like the Sony design team did an awful job on the physical aspect of this device. It slides off seemingly every elevated surface and inevitably slams its gorgeous ill-fated facade to the ground. For such a beautiful device, its not only a shame that it's going to have to be covered but also that it has incurred so much damage in the less than a week that I've had my phone due to its shape. It's truly disheartening that my brand new phone is now in roughly the same shape my (>2 year old) Z5 was in just a few weeks ago. Please understand that I spent much more on the XZ2 and only upgraded from the Z5 because the (then impeccable) screen shattered. All that considered, I really expected more out of a Sony device. Sony needs to go back to the drawing board with these curves! In my five days of experience with my XZ2, I've come to the conclusion that this and every poor XZ2 out there without a case is only destined to fall and to fail. Not only that butright out of the box, this phone has had awful battery life. After being fully charged, I can't get this phone to have enough power to last more than a few hours if I do anything except let it sit. Lastly, I have been experiencing feedback intermittently on my XZ2 since I made my first phone call.;Felicia Bergstrand;30-May-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;sony,design,team,device,screen,sony,case,phone,battery,phone,phone;2,2,0,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,2

5.0 out of 5 stars;Potentially not Unlocked;When I first received this phone and installed my SIM card it wasn't able to receive text messages. It was able to send them and was also able to make and receive calls. My initial thought was there must be a problem with the activation. I spent several days dealing with Verizon and finally a network tier support called me. What they did was disable a callback feature on their end and that resolved the issue. If anyone else is having this problem and you have Verizon DO NOT return the phone. Call Verizon and have them disable this feature. On another note I love this phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars;From amazon wharehouse deal - Not a scratch, freakin' fast;"So I hate how every phone is a tablet these days. If I want to watch TV I have a 65"" TV. if i want a tablet, i have a 10.1 tablet. If i needed a laptop, I have a laptop. I want my phone to be a f@#$#@$ phone.

Sadly my Samsung S4 mini was no longer supported by my carrier. They gave me a free 64gb s6 edge. The first s6 died within 6 months, and it was replaced. the second one died 6 months after that, and it was replaced. The third one lasted about a year and change but the screen finally stopped responding after a few run ins while skiing. I used a mouse for a while to work the screen with an OTG cable, but that stopped being feasible.

This is the smallest non-apple phone I could find. So far its great. It is a little heavy but I don't find that an issue.

Its ergonomics are way way better than s6 edge (the curves on the edge are on the wrong side of the phone). this can be comfortably used one handed without being andre the giant (the samsung had a feature that would shrink the screen so you could use it one handed).

I got this from amazon warehouse, in like new condition. It arrived with everything, and not a scratch or dent or anything to the device. The box was pretty beat up though and the charger was a little dirty.

I popped my sim card out of the s6 edge and into the xz2 compact, and it fired right up, on verizon, no problems.

I did a speed test on the cell network with this phone and got 70/25 Mbps down/up at my office. I do not know what I will get at my house as i usually do not have service at my house.";AR;31-Jan-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,phone,phone,screen,phone,phone;0,2,2,2,2,2
3.0 out of 5 stars;Tough and Fast but Too Many Factory Apps;"I bought the Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact recently after my old phone started to become increasingly slow and unstable. I had a short checklist of things I wanted out of it: 1) reasonable price, 2) compact size, 3) high speed, 4) good camera, and 5) sturdy design. On the whole, it lives up to these criteria, though there are caveats which you should bear in mind, listed below.

For the most part, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact is a good bargain. I found it on Amazon on sale for $449.99 ($480.36 with tax), making it competitively priced for a new phone by a reputable company. The screen is very tall and narrow, allowing the phone to fit comfortably in the palm of your hand but unfortunately compressing the letters on the virtual keypad to the point where it's extremely difficult to type. The camera is good, taking clear and crisp photos with a good balance of light and color, though it's still important to get low-contrast ambient light for the best photos. The videos are very good and provide a surprising amount of detail, though the audio is often shallow and tinny. The CPU is fast and can handle almost anything I've thrown at it, often juggling Snapchat, Instagram, and Messenger at the same time without a huccup. (The one exception was a very large text file which I opened in Docs, which took at least a minute and a half to fully load, confirming that this is definitely not a replacement for your laptop or macbook.) Finally it has a sturdy metal body with a glass screen, both of which appear to be capable of withstanding some serious punishment.

The biggest caveat, however, is the presence of factory-installed apps. They're everywhere on this phone. From Amazon Prime to Duo to Xperia Assist to Swiftkey, there are a host of useless apps on the Sony Xperia XZ2 which make the process of customizing it to your personal tastes EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Of course it's possible to sort through all of the apps that come with this phone and manually disable them, but it takes a significant amount of time and energy and can be extremely frustrating to anyone who doesn't have a degree in software engineering.

Despite these caveats, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact is a good bargain on the whole. It doesn't have the fastest CPU or the sharpest camera or the sleekest design, but it does the job well across a number of different criteria and is affordably priced at $468.28 on Amazon, as of Feb. 15th, 2019. Make no mistake: it's definitely not an iPhone. But if you're looking for a fast and tough jack-of-all-trades that won't break your bank account, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact is a good option to keep in mind.";Truth Seeker;18-Feb-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;sony,phone,price,design,camera,photo,photo,video,phone,camera,cpu;2,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,2,1,1
2.0 out of 5 stars;"I was let down; not fully verizon compatible";"I had been looking at this phone, reading reviews and wanting one since it was released and I finally bought an unlocked one here off amazon a month ago.  I can't say I was impressed.  Maybe it was due to my unfamiliarity with a Sony or unlocked phone, maybe I'm used to carrier bloatware, but, I did not like this phone at all.  Additionally, I was not impressed with the camera at all, very poor photos in dim or low light conditions.  I did love the size though and wish there were more options for phones in this size.  I have large hands with fat clumsy fingers and this phone fit me great.

The biggest problem I had was that this phone is not fully compatible with Verizon.  Wi-Fi calling is not available, visual voicemail is not available, MMS messages are not compatible and it had serious issues recognizing a sim card.  I spent hours reading though forums trying to solve these issues, spent hours at a Verizon store with a very helpful and smart tech who could not figure it out.  Thus, I returned it.";MDJ;28-Nov-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,camera,photo,hand;2,1,0,2
3.0 out of 5 stars;A great compact phone with a few design flaws;"I really wanted to like this phone, the 1080P screen, though not OLED, is very sharp and color accurate. It is easy to hold, but the 5 inch display on this phone just feels off to use, it is way to narrow. The Sony ROM is pretty good, not many bloat like the typical Samsung. The phone is snappy, since it is a flagship.
There are a lot of good to this phone, but the few minor flaws just defeats the purpose.
There is no headphone jack which is not a big deal for me, as I use wireless headphones anyway, but with the not slim body, I don't see why not have one. The fingerprint sensor is at a very low position, i have touched the lense many many times. The volume rocker is very good, but at a weird place again, because the power button no longer is a fingerprint sensor, i kept hitting the volume down button thinking it was the power button. The stereo speakers are not nearly loud enough, i had to keep it on max volume while trying to watch Netflix.";Evan;24-Nov-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,screen,phone,body,button,button;2,2,2,2,2,2

5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent phone;"About 1/2 years ago, I bought this phone as replacement of a lost phone because  is smaller with a high resolution screen and high-end specs. It is very comfortable to hold and use with one hand with a thin hard-plastic case.
 The first pleasant surprise was the fast update to PIE soon after the release by google, and the onging monthly security updates of the system by Sony.
 It is very sturdy for outdoor use including mapping in my car (Miata), 'navigation' plotting while sailing in coastal waters with lots of salt water spray, rain and the occasional drop e.g. in a parking lot (the case cracked and had to be replaced onces). Still, the phone looks like new.
 The camera cannot compete with an SLR as none of cell phones can but works great for snapshots but in very low light
when artifacts start to show up when cropping the image.
 This phone by Sony is underrated in a field dominated of ever growing, over-hyped tablet-like phones because 'consumers want them'  though there is hope that this trend will reverse. Renders of Apple's upcoming 2019 lineup include a compact model overcoming the limitations of the SE and closely resembling this phone in overall appearance but a large notch rather than a similar sized black bar on the top and bottom.";Irritated by reviews;27-Apr-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,resolution,hand,case,image,sony,camera;2,1,2,2,1,1,0
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work on Verizon properly;"I bought this phone because I wanted a modern, small phone that worked well.  I liked the old Sony I had on Verizon and being still on VZW I believed Amazon and bought this one.  Hey, it says COMPATIBLE right there, yes?

Well, it almost is.

It can make calls, receive calls and talks to my network.  Verizon says it's online.  I can send texts.  BUT I CANNOT RECEIVE TEXT.

I spend 2.5 hours on the phone with Verizon.  I will say VZW support is fantastic.  They put up with all my crap.  I rotate phones like I change socks.  But after going up through the chain with Verizon support, they were never able to solve the problem.  I finally gave up and returned the phone.  That is really sad because the phone is beautiful.  Fast, small, great sound, great screen.  If Sony comes up with another compact phone that IS compatible, I will be all over it.

4.0 out of 5 stars;A high performance smartphone in what today is considered a small size;"--[ UPDATE BELOW ]--

Large displays are part of the zeitgeist of the millennium, but I like small smartphones despite being an appalling screen-keyboard typist (still mourning the demise of the BB keyboard) -- this would have been an ideal model of existential conflict for Kierkegaard's ideas had phones been in use in the mid-1800s. When my Samsung S4 recently developed an irregular ""SIM card not detected"" syndrome (in my case only curable by uninstalling some apps I needed), there seemed to be only three small size phones to replace it. Two of them are currently behind the curve, leaving the XZ2-compact as my only choice.

I waited to buy it until it was sold and shipped by Amazon to facilitate its return if needed. Initially sold in North America at a too ambitious list price that was reduced in September 2018, the sale price here is about 25% less than the original list price, which seems a good deal for an only 10 month old model. My US carrier is AT&T <sigh>, so I took the phone to one of its stores to get it ready; simply cropping the SIM card of my S4 with a card cropper (to fit the Sony's nano-SIM holder) was all the hardware change needed.

The phone contains all the important innards --but for just a few-- of the standard XZ2 model into a 10% smaller body, which results in a shifting of the camera lens closer to the top edge of the compact model with almost no shift of the fingerprint sensor -- my first figure shows superimposed images of the sibling models based on actual size differences (yes, the lettering of the standard model is indeed 1.23 mm larger than that of the compact model). Although I have used it only a for a short period of time, it is clear that any obvious potential performance-degradation risks due to the packing has not affected the phone: It has the high level performance of its sibling (which I was able to test), a robust 19-megapix cam quality, and a fingerprint sensor on the back that finally works (until 2017 it was disabled in carrier-backed US models per agreement with domestic carriers).

The back of the phone is not flat but slightly convex with the rear camera lens and fingerprint sensor 4½"" and ca. 3¼"" above the bottom edge respectively. For my hand size (L-size gloves) it is very easy to put the index finger of the same hand holding the phone on the fingerprint sensor, which is more distant from the camera lens than in the standard XZ2 model; see figure. At 5.9 oz/168 g (or 7.3 oz/206 g with a TPU case and temperate glass screen protector), this phone has obvious weight, which is a bit surprising for its small size: for example, it is 30g heavier than a Samsung S4. Some might not like that, but I do like being aware (without discomfort) of which pocket I put the phone without need to search my clothing. Unless one's hands are small, it is easy to hold and use the phone with a single hand. The three control buttons are along the right edge of the screen side: they are operated with the thumb by right-handed people, and equally well or better with the other fingers by left-handed people. (Being ambidextrous I find it easier to control those buttons with my left middle, annular and small finger, with the index free to use the fingerprint sensor and the thumb to type.)

Relearning the location of Android menus from a Samsung to a Sony interface was not difficult despite the lack of a manual in the packing box. A User Guide in PDF format is available via a link in the Product information section. (This October 2018 guide version does not have the entry ""Unlocking your device automatically"" in p.13 of the March 2018 version.) Curiously, no information is provided on how to boot the phone in safe mode.

To insure the OEM-installed Facebook (an app I refuse to use) does not spy, track, or whatever else it may yet be discovered it is doing, I disabled the app. To insure no back door was left, I connected the phone to a Windows computer via the Xperia Companion (app available at the Sony website), expanded the ""Data"" folder of its parent ""Android"" folder [see my second figure] and deleted in there any folder ""com.sony . . ."" with the name facebook. (Save a backup copy of any folder before deleting it.) This is has not affected the XZ2's functioning at all, and has erased Facebook from the Apps Screen of the phone.

So far, I am quite satisfied with the XZ2 compact. The reason I do not give it 5 stars is that its automatic brightness control usually fails to increase the screen brightness when it needs to do so. I hope a future software rollout will take care of that. Though the February 2019 update of Android 9 Pie has moved the build number to version 52.0.A.3.202, the latest update I received so far has been the December 2018 one (build version 52.0.A.3.163).

UPDATE (March 11)
About a week ago I installed Android 9 (Pie) build 52.0.A.7.1 with no issues at all. With the exception of the automatic brightness control, this phone is a superb device. The battery life is delightfully long since I do not use phones for entertainment purposes.

ABOUT ITS IP65/68 RATING

Although such Ingress Protection [IP] rating means completely resistant to dust, resistant to low-pressure water jet spray for at least 3 minutes, and functional after immersion below a 1-meter minimum depth, the way Sony tested its phones for the IP rating has not always been rigorous. This forced Sony to correct in September 2015 its claims that Xperia phones were water-proof. They are not. This means that the XZ2 can get a little wet (e.g., caught in the rain or under an open faucet) *only* if all covers are firmly closed, and you do not push it too much. The XZ2 compact has a capless USB port -- it must be *completely dry* before charging or using the earphones.

For more information, visit the .com website ""support.sonymobile"" and search for the page ""Water and Dust Protection"" for the Xperia Xz family.";Abbe;23-Feb-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;size,phone,performance,phone,camera,fingerprint,fingerprint,button,fingerprint,phone;2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2

1.0 out of 5 stars;Design Nightmare!;"No FM Tuner, no headphone jack, flashlight basically doesn't exist, audio quality is lacking (audible static), uncomfortable fingerprint reader and button placement, no IR blaster. No capacitive buttons on bottom bezel.

I like that it has some heft to it and the convex back is good. Typing on this is great because the phone is easy to hold. Screen is fine.

If you want to do more than hold it though then you'll run into some issues. I don't know why they put the finger print reader in the center where you have to contort your finger to reach it. Oh and the camera wouldn't load half the time for some reason; the times that it did work it took almost 10 seconds to load. I tried to accept the lack of features and design flaws but they wouldn't stop adding up until I became too frustrated.

If Sony didn't disable the fm tuner, if it had a headphone jack out the bottom, if the flashlight was as bright as my S7, if the bottom bezel was used for something, if all the buttons were on the left side instead of right... then I wouldn't have returned it.";A.

2.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty phone but glitchy;Honestly I wanted to love this phone. I thought the minty color was gorgeous and liked the smaller size. However, just a day or two after I started using it, the speaker seemed to randomly glitch out. The alarm clock sound woke me up with a bunch of static instead of the alarm sound which was mildly concerning. But then the next day it went back to normal. About a week later it happened again with a random notification sound. The speaker randomly failing like that is not something that should be happening on a brand new phone. Another thing I noticed is that it would be very laggy and not want to open apps sometimes. Even when I halted all processes and only had one app running it would seem to struggle. So because of these issues I decided to return it and just went with a Samsung Galaxy s9 instead. I've had it for over a month now and have had none of the issues I had within the first week with the Sony phone. I'm very happy i went with that decision instead, and don't really recommend this phone. I really wanted to like it but it had some issues that it shouldn't have had. The galaxy s9 is close to the same price as this one at the moment and I recommend that one way more.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Great phone, but it ain't compact;"I've now owned 3 Sony compact smartphones. I like the product line. I went to them after Apple and everyone else decided we needed a tablet in our pockets instead of a phone. I absolutely loved my Xperia XZ1 Compact. It was the perfect size and it worked great. Unfortunately, it got stolen and I decided to replace it with the latest and greatest. But, this latest model is going in the wrong direction. It's beefy and heavy and oversized compared to my old phone. It's almost exactly the same dimensions of my wife's iPhone 8, and it's much thicker and heavier. This is not a compact phone anymore.

That being said, the phone is a great phone. It's fast and stable and it has Oreo installed and the battery life is great. If you want a phone this size, it's perfect. Unfortunately, I'd prefer something a little smaller. Still, it's better than 95% of phones out there if you want a small device.";DomLazz;9-Jan-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,phone,phone,phone,battery,phone,phone;2,2,2,1,2,1,1
5.0 out of 5 stars;Powerful little phone;"This phone works wonderfully!
I held on to an old phone for way too long simply because I couldn't find a small enough replacement for it. This is considerably larger than my old phone, but not too big to comfortably hold in one hand and still use.
I love how well it runs and how long the battery lasts. I feel like I got all of the good parts of a flagship phone without the excessive size.
Now, will note that being with Verizon, I had to disable visual voicemail to receive texts, and even then it initially had a very bad problem where if it disconnected from the network for more than about 15 minutes, it would never reconnect unless I did a factory reset on the phone. I went in and all they could think of to do was give me a new SIM card, and after one last factory reset, I haven't had the problem again. Anything that came close was solved by simply putting it in airplane mode and bringing it back out.
That being said, the phone is also pretty slippery, and I would strongly recommend using a case just for the grip.
All that said, I'm extremely satisfied with this phone.";Arden Barnes;21-Mar-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,phone,phone,battery,phone;2,2,2,2,1
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect Size, Perfect Features, and Perfect Camera;"First, this is the perfect size for a phone.  Note that this is the ""Compact"" version of Sony Xperia XZ2, small but it has almost all the quality features of the larger XZ2.  It's a little chunky and weighty.  It could be because of the good camera and good battery.

The battery gives me two days of normal use.  It drains fast only when I needed to serve a hotspot for my computer.  It charges very fast on a fast charger that I have, but it doesn't come with a fast charger.

Sony's camera on this phone is outstanding.  The pictures are very sharp and clear, better than any Android phones I have owned, and as good as that of the iPhone, if not better.  It has very good low light handling as well.  It also shoots 4K HDR video.  It also has a dedicated physical camera button so that you don't have to reach your fingers to the soft button on the screen.  Overall, if you care about having a good camera, this one would not disappoint you.

My most favorite feature of all is that it works on Verizon as well, which allows me more network options to hook it on to.  I swapped it with my current Verizon phone and it works seamlessly.

The speakers are loud and clear enough for its size.  With the speakerphone feature on, the microphone also transmits my voice from a nice distance clearly to the other end.

There are some bloatware and modifications that got me lost a bit even as an Android user for years.  However, there's nothing to cry about.

I bought this case for the phone and Iike it very much: Xperia XZ2 Compact Case, Ringke [Onyx] Brushed Metal Design [Flexible & Slim] Dynamic Stroked Line Pattern Durable Anti Slip Shock Absorbent Case with Wrist Strap for Sony Xperia XZ 2 Compact - Black

Overall, it's the best compact phone in the market.  Please feel free to ask me any questions about that phone that I may not have covered.

I couldn't interact with all parts of the screen, so I restarted it by holding down the power button for a few seconds. Now I see the Sony logo for a few seconds and and then the screen turns off. I don't get to the home screen at all :(. I'm out of the product return and support windows (1 month and 3 months respectively).

5.0 out of 5 stars;What is there not to like about it?;I quit purchasing the latest and greatest phone in keeping my Samsung Note Edge for almost 5 years. I needed something different and owned other Samsung and Apple phones.  I saw the Sony Xperia XZ2 phone in store and I liked the resolution and the way the phone felt in my hand.  Well, the price dropped $100 so I  got it for $400.00.  'Wow', is all I can say. Speed and the ease of use, fantastic. All my Samsung Droid apps transferred over instantly and began updating, smoothly without a problem. The fingerprint recognition works seamlessly and without delay (one thing I was worried about).  The color and resolution make the images almost lifelike. The speaker sound is full and vibrant, not that I was really expecting much.  Overall, I don't think you can get a better phone for the price point. If you are like me and refuse to pay a grand for a phone, consider the Sony Xperia.;J.

5.0 out of 5 stars;THICK - but that's OK;"Bought from a competitor but wanted to add a review here. A few weeks in and I have 0 complaints. I'm sure the camera could be better but I'm not a professional and they look great too me, and some band or calling feature I think I'm missing, but I've been able to take all my calls and send texts without any issues which is to say, I can't tell what's missing.

So from an average user who wants something that fits in a pocket (albeit sticks out a bit), is easy to hold and not drop (I can wrap my hand around the phone and reach the top with my thumb), and gets 5.5 to 6 hrs of screen on time (which for me is 1 to 1.5 days of usage) it's a ""10""...well a 5 of 5 here. It really is a joy to use and very simple to set up, with lots of tip and helpful suggestions in that first week of use.

Really my only complaint is the finger print reader - I have to bend my finger a bit to make that work.

3.0 out of 5 stars;The XZ2 Compact does NOT work with T-Mobile VoLTE/WiFi Calling;"The newest release in SONY's compact Xperia lineup offers some cool new technology, but also takes several steps in the wrong direction - ultimately resulting a disappointing user experience.  If you are a T-Mobile customer, there is a clear winner in the line-up - the previous Xperia XZ1 Compact (Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact - Factory Unlocked Phone - 4.6"" Screen - 32GB - Black (U.S. Warranty)).  Unlike the XZ2 Compact, the previous XZ1 Compact works with VoLTE/WiFi Calling technology, has an auxiliary audio port, and proper ergonomics for one-handed operation.  Read on for the specifics.

FUNCTIONALITY

As a phone, the Xperia XZ2 Compact isn't that great.  As mentioned, it doesn't support VoLTE/WiFI Calling technology (as tested on T-Mobile).  So while the previous XZ1 Compact works exceptionally well as a phone in my house due to WiFi calling, the XZ2 Compact fluctuates between 1 bar of reception to no reception at all, depending on what room I am in.  With the XZ2 Compact I once again get to experience missed calls that go straight to voicemail, text messages that arrive several minutes late and out of order, and MMS receive errors.  Total fail.

There are other shortcomings also.  The removal of the auxiliary audio port is irritating - especially considering the XZ2 Compact is thicker than the XZ1 Compact.  Aux ports are NOT an obsolete technology, this is something that is used!  Sometimes I don't want a bluetooth receiver on my head radiating my brain, I want simple wired earbuds.  Sometimes I like to connect my phone to hardwired sound systems.  All this is gone.  Sure, it comes with a USB-C dongle that does allow connections, but I will not be carrying this around with me all the time.

ERGONOMICS

The ergonomics are also a major step in the wrong direction when compared to the XZ1 Compact predecessor.  The screen is now much taller (see photographs).  This new size now prevents one-handed operation!  One-handed operation requires your pinky to balance and support the weight of the bottom of the phone, your other three fingers to support and balance the back of the phone, and your thumb to operate the touch screen.  But now your thumb will not reach the top of the screen due to the extra 1/2 inch of screen space.  And the top part of the screen that your thumb will not reach is frequently used - with back arrows, pull down menus, etc.

So in order to perform one-handed operations on the XZ2 Compact, your pinky must move out of position.  Now nothing is supporting the weight on the bottom edge underneath the phone, only your four fingers on the back of the phone.  This requires you to lay the phone flat horizontally on your four fingers so that the XZ2 Compact doesn't fall.  This is unnatural, hunching your shoulders and neck so that you can look directly down on the phone, instead of holding it at an angle in front of you.  It's also precarious, and the phone feels like it will drop easily.

So naturally, you use your other hand to support the phone.  No more one-handed operations - you'll need the XZ1 Compact for that.

The fingerprint scanner also aggravates one-handed operation.  Swiping a pattern or typing in a PIN on the XZ1 Compact doesn't require shifting any fingers supporting the phone.  However, using the fingerprint scanner on the XZ2 Compact does require your fingers to move out of position, which in turn requires your other hand to support the phone.  No one-handed operation with the fingerprint scanner either.  Unfortunately, the fingerprint scanner on the power button of the previous XZ1 Compact was disabled in the US market due to patent issues, but the right edge is a much better location for the scanner if one-handed operation is desired.

The Xperia XZ2 Compact is also heavier than the XZ1 Compact, which combined with the ergonomic problems makes a drop much more likely.

UPGRADES

If you do decide to purchase a XZ2 model, you will most likely want to upgrade the 64GB of internal storage with a microSDXC card.  As of this writing, your best value is the (Samsung 256GB EVO Plus Class 10 UHS-I microSDXC U3 with Adapter (MB-MC256GA)).  This 256GB Class 10 Grade 3 card will give read speeds up to 100 MB/s and writes up to 90 MB/s.  These speeds are important with the new 4K HDR camera.  You could buy and use a slower card unintentionally, so choose wisely... a slower card will still work but will result in reduced quality of video.

CAMERA

The one area that the XZ2 Compact trumps the previous XZ1 Compact is the video camera.  The 4k HDR video camera is better on the XZ2 Compact, allowing high dynamic range video that captures shots that would be impossible on the XZ1 Compact.  But this requires the full use of the Qualcomm® Snapdragon 845 processor to do the heavy 4k HDR lifting.  The XZ2 Compact battery will drain very fast when using this technology, and the phone is subject to over-heating.  The camera app even pops up a friendly warning that your phone may overheat and dial back the quality of HDR 4K video automatically.

In practice, I'm usually using taking photographs rather than video though - and the previous XZ1 Compact supports 4K video and HDR photography already.  And during my test shots on the new XZ2 Compact, I noticed the occasional stutter in the framerate with HDR enabled.  Cool technology nonetheless.

CONCLUSION

Most of the technology in the XZ2 Compact is at least on par with the XZ1 Compact.  Ultimately, I feel like the XZ2 Compact takes several steps in the wrong direction and doesn't bring enough innovation to the table.  Ergonomics aside, I do like the fingerprint scanner - it allows apps such as 1 Password to unlock without typing in a long master password constantly.  The new HDR camera is cool.  But as a phone, the previous XZ1 Compact is a superior product with proper ergonomics and VoLTE/WiFi Calling technology.  It's also less expensive now.

I'd also conclude that the larger Xperia XZ2 (Sony Xperia XZ2 Unlocked Smarphone - Dual SIM - 5.7"" Screen - 64GB - Deep Green (US Warranty) is a superior product to the XZ2 Compact - the screen is better, the dynamic ambient light works better, and the audio is better.  And since you are already having to use two hands, you might as well go for the more readable screen.

Sorry, I cannot recommend the Xperia XZ2 Compact.  There are better options in SONY's Xperia lineup.";Amazon Customer;14-Jul-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;technology,audio,phone,phone,technology,phone,support,screen,screen,phone,phone,phone,phone,phone,phone,processor,technology,camera;1,2,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,1,1
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great phone...until it died! Horrible customer service!;"I purchased this phone last November because I have small hands and it was among the most highly rated compact phones available. When it first arrived, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it! It was small but not flimsy, easy to maneuver, takes great pictures and the battery lasts for almost two days without needing a charge. I took it to the Verizon store and got it set up on my account with no problem.Recommended it to several other people I know who were looking for a good reliable compact phone....

Fast forward to three weeks ago - the phone just literally shut down. It had been working fine and I set it on my coffee table while I did some reading. Picked it up 15-20 minutes later to check the time and it was dead. I tried to reset it - I tried to plug it into the charger. I did the hard reset recommended on the Sony website. Nothing worked - I finally contacted Sony customer service and went through two days of getting a runaround from them. They said it was still under warranty BUT the only place to get it repaired or replaced was through the Sony service center, which is in Canada!

Long story short, I had to send my three month old phone to somewhere in Illinois, where they will ship it to somewhere in Canada, and determine what caused it to die, and then decide if they are going to repair it or give me a new phone. This process generally takes about a month and they offered me no replacement phone, no credit, NOTHING! I spoke with them today, two weeks after I sent it in, and it doesn't appear they have even started working on it!

I am currently using a Samsung Galaxy 7, which is a bit larger than what I wanted, but which Verizon provided to me at no cost, with free overnight shipping included! I really liked the Sony Experia but honestly, after what I have had to go through, I cannot recommend it to anyone! I told Customer Service that they cannot expect to compete in the global phone market with their current policies because no one can be without their phone for a month when there is a problem. The manager I spoke to agreed and said they have been trying to get Corporate to understand that but so far, no one is listening to them. Maybe when people stop buying their phones altogether they will finally wake up and make changes!";VikingMom;19-Mar-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,phone,battery,phone,phone;2,2,1,1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;Possibly the Best Phone I've Ever Had;"This Xperia XZ2 Compact is amazing.  Forget the big name sites saying Galaxy this or iPhone X that.  If you want a great Smartphone that can still fit in your hand without sticking out your back pocket, your search is over.

This year Sony redesigned their phones leaving behind the monolithic slabs they kept for so long.  Now we get rounded edges, and much less bezel (though still there).  We also see the fingerprint sensor come to the US and instead of the side (which was possibly the best sensor I’ve ever used) it’s a circle on the back.  I’m actually not a fan of this location but it’s fast and it works.  The phone has picked up a little weight and it’s not a light phone.  It might even garner chunky by your iphone toting pals.  But it feels so good in your hand.  Plus the battery life is top notch.  Unlike people who need to plug in their phones at lunch, you will be happily using your phone up until evening.

Screen is nice and includes HDR.  I won’t go into specs since everyone does that but the screen is very nice indeed. Speakers can get pretty loud and the camera is very good as well.  You might need to play around with it at first to get a feel for what settings give you the best shots but once you do…it’s great.

The Super Slow motion is very cool.  It can be tricky at first to get the shot you want, but when you do it is game changing.  People really like seeing this stuff at 960fps. Water flowing.  Matches being lit.  Someone jumping in air. It’s awesome.  Just make sure you have plenty of light for the super slow mo and you are good.

Phone is fast, and I’ve had no issues with it.  I’m currently using the phone on AT&T (I Know).  Apps are super quick to load, no crashes I’ve encountered.  There is a camera bug that some people have had where the camera crashes and needs to be restarted but I have not encountered it yet. If I do I will update the review.  Oh and I like this moss green color. It stands out in a sea of other phones.  I’ve never had as many people compliment and ask what kind of phone I have than with this.  Try one.";Therabbitssing;10-Aug-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;smartphone,phone,speaker,camera,phone;1,2,1,1,2
5.0 out of 5 stars;Small in size not in Powe;Great phone! Makes the OnePlus 6 I use for work feel like a tablet. I haven't used a phone this size in 3+ years. There is no performance difference between the OnePlus 6 and the XZ2 Compact, in fact I would say the screen is even crisper on the XZ2. Phone is easy to carry, software is a light overlay on Android, minimal bloatware with a premium feeling. Phone is amazing, put the tablet down and get a phone you can navigate with 1 HAND!!;Eddy C;19-Aug-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,performance,screen;1,2,2
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Small phone;"Moved to the XZ2 from the Xperia X compact. It's quick and compact. Biggest complaint is the design. I really liked the XCompact's blocky Alien Obelisk sort of look. The XZ2 looks much more inline with the trend of brushed metal and rounded edges. Finger print reader is a nice addition, while I don't use it for unlocking, it is perfectly placed for authenticating apps and services. Battery Care is still there and is still a great. Even after 2+ years, my XCompact still holds 18+ hours of casual use on a single charge, and so far the XZ2 is shaping up to given similar performance.

It's also worth mentioning that, while it wouldn't be considered top of the line, for the price this phone is a damn steal.";wyatt white;23-Apr-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;design,battery,price;0,2,1
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent phone, compact / fast and feature filled;"This phone is ""hand sized"" but full featured.. Not bulky as the others that I have owned, I am coming from a 5.5 screen to  this phone. What makes it work , size wise it that it is not as wide , so holds in the hand comfortably. Finger print sensor works and is on the rear. Using with a small Qi wireless receiver between the case and phone, so nowI have wireless charging.  IT does work on Verizon, but I had to call VW and get them to turn on some CDMA feature code. Apparently Verizon made some changes even though the phone is certified by them and that I confirmed with them, issue was with the inability to receive test messages.. could send but not receive.. Once corrected no problems. This phone may be small but it packs a great processor and it is fast.. Fits in my pocket, not bulky.  Seems these days, phones are getting bigger and bigger.. you might as well buy a tablet or lug a desktop around; or buy a compact...";Michael F.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Great display and fast performance. Definitely need a case, though.;"The Experia XZ2 Compact is a great phone for those that like smaller phones. The display is beautiful, the fingerprint sensor works great and the camera is good enough. I confirmed that the unlocked version works on Verizon as well as T-Mobile. The battery life is good, but could be better. Luckily, fast charging works well. The phone feels good in your hand, but is slippery, so I’d suggest a case. Another reason to use a case is that the buttons are very sensitive. I kept activating the camera and pushing the power button by accident over the course of my testing. One downside to getting a phone from an unpopular phone brand, is that the good case makers ignore the phone. Speck? Otterbox? Incipio? None of them will bother with a Sony phone. You have to resort to the cheaper cases that don’t offer a lot of style or the same level of protection as the premium case makers. I know this seems really minor, but I invest in great cases for my phones, because phones are really expensive!

I don’t mind the lack of headphone jack, especially since Sony includes a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter. The speakers are OK, but you know, it sounds better with headphones or Bluetooth speaker. Performance is excellent, thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor. Apps launch quickly and there’s hardly any lag when navigating the interface. It’s definitely faster than my old Galaxy S8. Unfortunately, it’s not enough for me to switch, because I’ve been using phones with big displays since the Samsung Note II and it’s difficult for me to go back to a smaller display. For those of you who like small phones, the XZ2 Compact is definitely a nice phone, but make sure to get a case for it.";Croissant;6-Aug-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,phone,fingerprint,camera,battery,performance,phone;1,2,1,1,2,1,1
2.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible Camera;Don't buy the XZ2 Compact. The camera on it is just plain AWFUL because it can't handle even a little backlight and it definitely can't handle lower-lighting. I am so disappointed. I previously had the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact, which had the same issues, and it was so irritating to see all my friends with Samsung or iPhones taking beautiful photos while we were out or on vacation, no issues with backlighting or even total night shots, and these Sony pieces of crap giving horrendous results, even in basic everyday situations. I was so excited to upgrade because according to official reviews, Sony upgraded its camera from the Z5 to the XZ1/XZ2. It's not true. The camera on this XZ2 Compact is just as bad. It's unusable in anything but good conditions. I have to ask my friends to send me the photos they take on their Samsungs. Sony, you fooled me once, and then fooled me twice... there isn't going to be a third. What a joke.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Sony knocks it out of the park with the XZ2;"This is the compact model, with a 5"" screen, so if you're looking for a ""phablet"" and want to carry around a giganto 6"" screen, and have Verizon as your provider, make another choice.  This is Sony's flagship from early 2018, and the price was exactly where I needed it to be. The screen is vivid and bright in direct sunlight, and the camera....well it's a Sony! The folks at the local Verizon store were enamoured instantly with this phone, since all they sell are iphones and various samsung models.  Still easy to transfer all my stuff from my S4: they were extremely helpful, and charged me nothing for the new SIM, transferring and such.  I would have purchased a case from them, had they had anything that would fit this Sony model.  I was originally looking at the Sony XZ3, but alas, as of this writing, it is not Verizon ""certified"".  In any case, there are very few under $500 phones that are this full featured.  No headphone jack! Dongle included.  Dont lose it!  Not all USB C to 3.5mm jack dongles are compatible with one another.  Great sound, though....its a SONY. If you want a stylish looking, excellent Android phone, this may be your ticket.  I am certainly more than pleased with the XZ2.";ElderGeek;19-Feb-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;screen,sony,camera,sony,phone,case,sony,phone;2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2
4.0 out of 5 stars;"Great 5"" powerful phone";"My review of the Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact will focus on my experience using it and my take on this powerful but smaller phone. Tech Specs are above.

Today's world has phones getting bigger and bigger. Going with a 5” display may seem like a step backwards and has an almost retro look.

I've used a 6” android and a 5.7” (with small upper screen) over the last several years and have become used to a larger display, although the size of the phone was large to keep in my pocket. Add a heavy duty case, it became annoying to the point I switched to a flip case. I also found myself connected to the internet, emails, etc constantly.

That said, I thought, why not give a 5” display a shot? How much would about 1” make? In this case, 1” does matter. I'm now adjusting to the size out of the box.

The Set-up

Speaking of the box, the phone comes with: – a quick charger cable and adapter, wired Sony earbuds and a dongle to plug the buds into in order to use the USB-C port as the connector. No, it doesn't come with neither wireless buds nor earphones with an already built-in USB-C cable. Note: There is no earphone jack. All this is somewhat odd to me. I don't use the plug in earphones and have several wireless (one for phone, one for music, one for back-up if both of those need to be charged) but I always have wired earbuds around due to the simplicity when needed and not having to worry about charging. Not having a jack, the XZ2 is going the way of the future by not including it. Not a great idea. The dongle works fine, but I couldn't charge the phone since the port was being used.

Comfortable in my hand. The plastic back cover feels a bit slippery so I recommend a case.
I've searched for a good screen protector and haven't had luck with finding great reviews on such a new phone. I believe Sony recommends a film, not a tempered glass protector, likely due to the curved shape. The wave of curved phones make it difficult to find good glass protectors that cover properly. I'll be getting a flip style. This does have Corning Gorilla Glass 5, but I'll likely put a protector on it for additional protection when I find one.

The set-up took about 10 or so minutes configuring it's updates.

Transferring my data from my other phone was easy as pressing the phones back to back via NFC.

First time charging:
(Edited to correct: in Stamina mode, the phone slows down charging speed at 90% to preserve the life of the battery)

32% - 74%  36 minutes
74% - 91%  42 minutes
91% - 100% 39 minutes

32 – 100% charging time: 1 hr, 57 min. Not super-fast. (See above correction re: Stamina mode which slows charge at 90% preserving life of battery)

Pairing things via BT: Had to reset my Smartwatch to factory settings and it immediately paired.
Same quick experience with my TILEs and Headsets.

After several days of use:

Getting used to using the smaller factor. Have not used it too much due to not having a case yet. Returning the one I ordered was poorly made.

Newest Charging speeds:
17 – 45% 28 minutes
45 – 84% 51 minutes

Using a Battery charging app:
17 – 29%  09 minutes
32 – 100%  2 hours

With screentime on the XZ2 depleted from 100% to 17% over 3 hrs, 57 minutes (with average usage) which is OK, but I expected a bit more.

Utilizing the Battery-saver modes. They are called “Stamina” disabling some functions and Ultra Stamina limiting to the most necessary usage”. With my phone idle for 15 hrs, 15 mins the battery depleted only 9%. Note: I have the following On such as WiFi, NFC, approximately 40% brightness, and Mobile data, email syncing, etc. I like the adjustable choice of Stamina mode which doesn't restrict you to a few options.

I depleted the phone battery down to 5% and it took 3 hours, 4 minutes to charge back to 100%.  It's new so I hope this improves.

I typically keep my phone charged between 20 – 80%. It charged from 5 – 73% in 1 hour, 40 minutes which was good.

First 2 weeks of use:

I love the smaller form factor. One of my intentions of going back to a smaller phone was to not use the phone so much. Unfortunately (or fortunately for Sony) I've liked the comfortable grip and have still used it a lot in trying to break my cell addiction. The idea was if I wanted to be “hooked up” I'd need to pick up my Tablet or iPad, which wasn't as convenient.

My larger Phablets make it too easy to constantly do anything, especially waste time better spent on something else. If you prefer the larger screens, the XZ2 would be a better option with it's 5.7” screen.

This phone has very fast response. Fingerprint reader, Opening apps is slightly faster than my V20.

Takes great photos  No camera lag with focusing, quick focus and photo taking.

Battery Life: Very Good considering it is a small batter due to the phone's size.
Examples: Phone on 7 hrs 23m; Screentime On: 1 hr, 59 min; Battery used: 26%
Battery level from 69% - 43%

The Lowest: Phone on 8 hr, 4 min; Screentime on: 1 hr, 49 min; Battery used: 49%
Battery level from 65% - 16%

Call Quality: Great

BT Connections: quickly hooked up to all of my devices. No dropped connections (yet!)

Pre-Installed Apps – fewer than typical locked phones. I uninstalled a couple like PlayStation which I don't need.

3D scanning is a cool feature, but more gimmicky. I've only tried it out once and apparently do not have steady hands!

The price is rather hefty, but I think all new phone prices are excessive between $600 - $1000. Most of us barely get 2 years usage before we want the latest new technology and updates. I believe the Compact XZ2 is for the specific consumers who want both a smaller phone to put in your pocket and have the great specs of a 5.7 – 6” phone. Keep in mind it's smaller but not as thin.

No headphone jack is remedied by a dongle, so not a deal breaker. Sound through my BT earphones was good (and of course it may also depened on your BT brand).

This comes with Android Oreo 8.0.0 out of the box and a security patch level as of 6/1/18. In comparison, I am still waiting for my LG V2  to update past 7.0 and a 11/2017 security patch.

I still have not had much luck finding a screen protector yet. Like other newer phones, it has a curved screen and the few reviews I've read give protectors bad reviews. Waiting for a realistic review that understands it will not cover the entire screen.

Cannot find the OEM Touch Case which I would like. I've tried two inexpensive flip cases, one was so bad I returned, the other eh, good enough but looking to get rid of it. Another thing, I'd prefer not to have a flip case, unless it is the thin Sony Touch, as it adds bulk to an already bulkier than average phone. I'm using a flip case just to protect the screen until I can find a good protector. Anyone know of any, please let me know.

I hope this review has been of some assistance in understanding my experience using it, not focusing much on specs already listed by Sony. I'd give it 4 and half Stars, deducting only for no wireless charging, somewhat bulky body, and  the fingerprint sensor could've been a little higher.";Larkhall;13-Jun-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;sony,phone,phone,phone,phone,screen,phone,sony,glass,battery,phone,phone,fingerprint;2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,2

5.0 out of 5 stars;Beast of a small phone;"If you compare it to older compact xperias, this is small, the screen just occupied where some of the bezels were. People can now be happy for the less bezels. I do believe Sony is a bit late in this, as more phones are now are almost bezeless. I don't really care too much about that, but I do like the less bezels, so I guess I do care about it a bit. I like that it looks curvy. The fingerprint sensor needs a bit of getting used to because it is in the middle in the back. This is compact though which may have something to do with my getting used to the fingerprint sensor placement really quickly.
Definitely looks elegant especially with the glossy like and very slightly curved edge screen.
Pictures look vibrant on this and you can pick three color settings in this but colors really pop out on the vivid mode. Standard mode is good enough for regular use. It has a 1080p so it is sharp and since it's small,  netflix videos look so stunning in this.
The camera is very good, as usual, you'd have to be pretty good at manual to produce perfect pictures. You don't have to fiddle a lot with video settings, you'll get good results taking videos from this phone, even the stabilization.
The performance is, of course, excellent. It has SD 845 in so that explains itself. I had trouble with an app called Imgur though. I love the app but for some reason, the phone heats up if the app is used for about like 5 minutes, and that eats up a lot of battery.
The battery is pretty decent. Normally I'd get 5 to 6 hours screen time with this. I do use bluetooth and gps for a driver's insurance app so the screen time goes down an hour.
The usb-c headphones doesn't bother me much. I am ok with using a dongle. I have two of them, on for regular, and one for work, and I keep them on my headphones. I do understand it is a bit inconvenient for users who listen to music while charging and for the premium headphone users. My ear is probably not as good as an audiophile's but the dongle system is quite all right. I used the sony MDR 7550 and xb90ex and they both sound fantastic in this phone even if I use the dongle.
The front facing speakers sounds all right, not tinny. Can get loud enough.
Very solid phone still amazes me even after months of having it.";Aldee;11-Jan-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,bezel,fingerprint,fingerprint,performance,battery,headphone;2,0,2,2,2,2,2

1.0 out of 5 stars;Apparently finger print sensor has been disabled for USA;"This phone has actually been wonderful. Fast and does everything with ease including great battery life and little to no bloatware if you choose. Literally no problems up to this point .

UNTIL a few days ago. My fingerprint sensor has essentially gone missing from my phone. No option for it in settings and doesn't respond to touch, its as if it has been completely removed from phone. This is after 4 months of ownership. I did everything to try and fix it myself. Sony initially had me do several things including complete software repair through my computer and after this didn't work they told me it had been disabled for US phones? Nothing online about this for xz2 compact (there is for older models with sensor in power button). So after going back and forth with Sony they would not give me straight answer of whether it is supposed to work or not!!! Offered to send it to repair sensor and maybe they could ""fix"" it but there is possibility it would be sent back with same issue? But then wouldn't answer whether or not it is supposed to work!!!

2.0 out of 5 stars;The only smartphone that can be used with one hand (UPDATE);"Sony is the only brand that offers a smartphone with all the top characteristics in a small package. Other brands offers smartphones with the name of the big brother but with half the characteristics, not just the screen size and the battery, but less capable processor, less ram, less storage, worst camera... Sony keeps offering a great battery life and a years in advance camera than the competitors. I lack a better image processing in still photograph, but the video in 4K HDR is awesome, the 960fps shoot is amazing, the screen as usual accurate to reality colors.
-UPDATE-
I keep what I said above, but I had a Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and it had the same problem I'm having again with this one. The bottom speaker is failing. It sounds creepy and it is going worst every day and I know the result, a muted speaker that is used by mostly apps, so you will be having a phone with muted Google Maps, muted handsfree, muted everything, the only thing that will work in a 50% is the videos as they are stereo, so you will hear them via the top speaker.
(Next part is the one I wrote back in time when I bought it. I don't keep the ""I highly recommend it"". It's true that is a good phone, but if it keeps breaking with the same problems something is not solved.)
I highly recommend this smartphone, Sony hasn't the best marketing campaigns, but the technology they produce is in many ways better than the more famous competitors, was the first to offer a waterproof phone since the Xperia Z, and since then all the Xperia Z/XZ were waterproof, the first in offering a 4K display, the first offering 960fps capture, stereo speakers, triluminous display, IPS displays, the first with Hi-Res Audio...

sony was far less helpful. completely untrained and unknowledgeable reps kept repeating the same basic steps and kept trying to put it back on verizon. wouldn't even acknowledge the possibility that something was wrong with the phone itself.  they didn't even pretend to care. one chat rep asked if i had more questions and i sad yes - he referred me to an email he was sending with the solution and ended the chat - the email was a link to the sony support home page. home page. the start from scratch home page i clicked on before i gave up and chatted in with him on the first place.

1.0 out of 5 stars;You will regret buying this phone;Bought the Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact H8314 in September 2018, and while it worked OK when I got it, it has always had one or more issues making it difficult or impossible to use. Sony has obviously broken the underlying Android OS, and so it receives an endless stream of patches that cause new problems with each fix. Specifically, the fingerprint sensor, slow data over LTE, screen not responding to touch, screen lock not working, and now the cellular network connection will spontaneously quit working several times a day.;PoyH.;26-Apr-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;sony,sony,fingerprint,screen,screen,network;2,0,2,2,2,2
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent small android for Verizon;"I've been looking for a small android phone on Verizon for a while now.  My previous phone was an HTC One Remix (similar to One mini).  Most importantly for me, it's similar in size to an iphone 7 and works on Verizon.  Verizon doesn't sell it but it's compatible with their network.  Verizon has offered nothing but monsters and I prefer something that fits easily in my pocket.

The XZ2 Compact has most of the features I want.  The camera seems to take great pictures.  The fingerprint sensor works very well.  It's fast by comparison to my old phone, unsurprisingly.  And the crapware doesn't seem to  be ever present.  It's also cheaper than the Google Pixel 2 as well as smaller.  I understand that the Pixel is probably a slightly better phone, but this was a close second in reviews, smaller, and $150 cheaper.

Now downsides: it doesn't have Qi wireless charging, which would be nice, but not a huge deal to me.  Also I'm not thrilled about the lack of an earphone plug, but it does include a usb-c adapter.  Lastly, the phone is surprisingly heavier and thicker than I expected in comparison to the HTC One Remix.  Hopefully that is mostly battery and will contribute to good battery life.  I haven't had the phone long enough to gauge battery life well.";Jerry Quinn;30-Sep-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,size,network,camera,fingerprint,phone,battery,battery;2,2,1,1,2,1,1,2

5.0 out of 5 stars;Incredible Phone;"***see end of page

This is a very early review, but my first impression is that this is a top notch well thought out device.  The fit of the device in my hand is absolutely perfect, the screen is crisp and clear and comes with built in tools to test all pixels.  The dedicated camera button is much welcomed,  and the camera is fast and pictures are magnificent indoors and out.  The Snapdragon 845 is incredibly fast compared to my 600 series chipset on my last phone, there is absolutely no lag.  Android Pie is available for download now (01-14-2019), as well, the Sony GUI and apps are updated to support and fully integrate into the updated Android OS.  Sony has done an incredible job with both the hardware and software on this device, hats off to a job well done.  I purchased the short version type C wireless charging receiver by Nillkin Magic as well as a charge plate to compensate for the lack of wireless charging.  Another reviewer has confirmed that this wireless charging solution works well with this phone.  In addition, I purchased a SanDisk 400GB Extreme microSD UHS-I Card, you'll need the extreme version to record in 4k (the ultra version of this card spawns errors due to insufficient sustained write speed for 4k video).  I purchased multiple covers, I will update the review to confirm which ones support the wireless charging receiver.  In my opinion, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact is the absolute best no compromise compact phone on the market today and it's a safe bet that this device will not let you down.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Small and powerful;Overall, this is a very good compact phone. I tried it with both Verizon and ATT, and it worked with both networks. As more phone companies aim for a bigger screen, Sony has taken their top of the line Xperia phone and made it smaller.  It fits nicely in the hand, and the screen is super sharp, bright, and colorful.  I opened a few apps, checked email, and made a few phone calls. Everything operated smoothly and quickly. This is a great second phone for me since I am not willing to give up my Google Nexus 6P just yet, but when I decide to go smaller, the Sony Xperia XZ compact would be a great choice.;Herschel Greenberg;12-Aug-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-Compact-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07B821WFJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,phone,phone,sony;2,2,2,2

The screen is beautiful for a phone- it really does take the whole ""phone"" thing to an entirely new level. I will admit that we are mostly iPhone people in day-to-day use, but phones like this make me consider switching all of us over simply because the clarity of the screen and the camera is beyond what is available to us in the Apple range.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Wonderful phone;I think cell phones are really about personal preference, what I like may not be the same for someone else. Let me start with the fingerprint scanner, it is in a perfect place for me.  I don't have huge hands and due to the length, I'm not stretching my finger around to find the scanner, I have never accidentally hovered over the camera.  One on the other things I love is the camera system. How many phones come with a dedicated camera button?  This was a feature I missed on my previous phone.  The camera itself is located in such a great position.  I've haven't accidentally taken a picture of my finger when holding it in landscape mode.  The system is snappy and fluid.  The screen looks awesome.  I just wish manufactures would bring back the headphone jack.  This was a bundle purchase with the xperia duo headset.  At first they were awkward to put on but after a few tries you get used to them quickly.  They don't seal into the ear like my other headset which is nice.  They sound amazing.  Overall this is a great phone and headset.

4.0 out of 5 stars;A svelte, powerful flagship that should be less expensive;"Being a Vine reviewer puts me in a strange position relative to most phone users. I keep getting offered Sony phones, because I've reviewed them in the past. I have now reviewed the XA1, XZ1, XZ2, and XZ2 Premium. So I have a very fine grained perspective when it comes to the XZ3, and will approach this from the aspect of ""which Sony phone should you choose?""

*Why Sony?*

First, I suppose, is the question of ""Why a Sony Phone?"" Well, the answer to my mind is an emphasis on entertainment, with excellent screens and front-facing stereo speakers. Second is camera, with an emphasis on high detail, high-megapixel photos. Third is general build quality - Sony makes beautiful hardware. Now, of course, Apple and Samsung also do these three things pretty well, too. They take differing approaches to camera and A/V quality, but I do think these three companies are within spitting distance of each other.

*Sony’s 2018 Lineup*

OK, Now, I'm going to compare the three most recent Sony models - the XZ2, XZ2 Premium, and XZ3. I don't know what Sony execs are smoking over there in Tokyo, but they have decided to release these models within 6 months of each other - from April through October 2018, respectively. So new stock is still available for all three. Why they chose to cannibalize themselves this way is beyond me. I can't imagine an XZ2 buyer being very happy with Sony releasing the XZ3 a bit less than 6 months after they plunked down for their current phone.

All three phones share Sony's new ""Ambient Flow"" design language. This means they are round, slippery, shiny glass sandwich phones that have reduced bezels compared to their predecessors and a fingerprint sensor in the center of the rear of the phone body. All three share the ""Motion Eye"" camera sensor that excels at 960fps slow motion filming, 4K HDR video, and capturing bursts of moving still shots while staying in focus. All three utilize the Snapdragon 845 system-on-a-chip with Adreno 630 graphics. So they are all very capable 2018 Android flagships.

The differences: The XZ2 has 4gb of RAM on board. It has an 18:9 IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1080x2160. The XZ2 Premium has 6gb of RAM, a 16:9 4K IPS LCD screen at 3840x2160, and a second monochrome camera module for improved low light performance. The XZ3 kind of splits the difference between the two. It has 4gb of RAM, the same camera module as the XZ2, but upgrades the 18:9 screen to a 6 inch HDR OLED display with a resolution of 1440x1880. Price wise, these models are going for 700, 1000, and 900 respectively at present.

So the $200 difference between the XZ2 and XZ3 all comes down to the screen. And I will say, it is an absolutely beautiful screen. The blacks are as close to zero as they eye can see, and the brightness for HDR video is spectacular. It also has the trendy curved side edges that you might like on the Samsung Galaxy line. But otherwise, the XZ3 is functionally identical to the XZ2. It performs the same, gets basically the same 1-day battery life (5-6 hours of screen on time), and takes identical pictures. I would say the price premium is only justified if you really prize the display and watch a lot of high quality video.

The XZ2 Premium is a bit of a different beast. It does perform basically identically on Android tasks, given the same internals. The 6gb of RAM seem to be dedicated to the camera, which is the big differentiator. Adding the second low-light module to the camera does improve low light performance over the XZ2 and XZ3. It’s not night and day (so to speak) but the differences are clearly there upon close inspection. There is more detail and less noise on the XZ2 Premium’s low light photos. Its screen is the highest resolution of the bunch, and it performs well with HDR video – though the XZ3 probably beats it with its deeper native contrast ratio. Now, is this worth a $300 price premium over the XZ2? Personally, I don’t think so. Given the choice of which one to use for free, I’ll take the XZ2 Premium. But if I were doing the math on my own budget, the XZ2 would be extremely tempting.

*XZ3 Specific notes*

The XZ3 does also add a few new features, almost all of which are superfluous. “Side Sense” brings up a shortcut menu when you double tap the curved edges of the screen. It is prone to misfires, though, so is more of an annoyance than anything. The phone also recognizes when you pull it out of your pocket and orient it in landscape, and pulls up the camera. But since you still have to tap the screen to initiate the camera, it really offers no benefit over the (wonderful) dedicated shutter button.

The XZ3 is probably the prettiest of the three phones, and is also the lightest. If you’re into comparing phones with your friends, it is likely the one which will get the most “oohs and aahs” next to a Galaxy S9 or iPhone Xs.

A case is an absolute necessity, since the phone is so thin, svelte, and slippery. I almost dropped it several times before nestling it into its excellent Ringke Fusion X case.

*Conclusion*

People who want to buy a Sony phone have been put in a hard spot by… Sony. It has released three similar flagship phones within 6 months. All three of the phones perform basically identically when it comes to speed. The XZ3 has the best screen. The XZ2 Premium has the best camera. Which of these three areas of performance you value most is how you should make your decision if a Sony phone is in your future. I frankly think the XZ2 will offer the best bang-for-buck for most users. It is also the model that is now best situated to compete with phones like the OnePlus 6T on price. Only those who seriously prioritize display or camera should consider the “step-up” models, which come at a significant price premium.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Bumping Shoulders With Perfection But Still Needs Some Help;"Pros:
  The screen is stunning. I'll be watching a lot more videos on this phone than usual.
  The design is really well thought out and feels very premium and sturdy. It feels like top notch materials were used.
  A lot of little things have been refined coming from other Xperia devices, such as double tap to wake being added, stamina mode performance is increased so typing isn't an issue, reworked camera app.

Cons:
  The phone is lacking WiFi calling and VoLTE support on the T-mobile network (I'm assuming this is the same for all US carriers). This is a huge let down and really impacts the effectiveness of this device as a cell phone.
  The screen is so great that I'm going to be wasting a lot of battery watching videos. Oh well.
  Some of my initial camera shots with medium light came out a little grainy. I'm not sure if this is an isolated issue but it's still less than ideal in a $900 phone.
  Lack of support in the U. S. in some ways, such as lack of accessories or carrier support.

Full review:
  Starting out with the design, the phone definitely feels great. It's a big phone, yet it still manages to feel elegant in the hand. It's a bit heavy but the weight is distributed evenly so it isn't very apparent. The build quality appears to be very premium and I imagine it will hold up well to time, as most Sony phones I have had tend to last. Almost every review I've heard on this phone has made some mention of the finger print sensor location being too low. I have average sized hands and make contact with the sensor every time. I think I prefer this location over one that is higher up only because I'd rather bend my finger to make contact with the sensor instead of stretching it. This is one of those things that is purely a personal preference and I think reviewers are complaining to complain, what's new.
  The software is very familiar if you've ever used a Sony/Android phone before, and is easy to learn if you haven't. If you're thinking about switching from an iPhone, Android is quite a liberating experience, and Sony makes it easy to transfer over with the Xperia Companion App. A couple new software features have been added, such as the side sense feature which is similar to the HTC and Pixel phone squeezes, although it may not be entirely as reliable, but I still find it quite useful. I have heard of some users complaining about accidently activating side sense, but I haven't had that issue (either due to how I hold the phone or possibly an update, I'm not sure which)(actually just kidding I see what they're talking about now, if your palms or fingers overlap onto the screen, it picks it up as a tap occasionally). Everything feels very fluid and I doubt it would be any different if Sony did include 6GB of RAM, but hey six is bigger than four and I'm sure it wouldn't hurt the user that much to have more RAM, even with a slightly higher drain on battery. A boost mode would be cool to have if you wanted to utilize all 6 gigs at once, and then have it be off during typical use. The new android 9 pie operating system doesn't seem all that different from 8, but I believe that is a good thing because most software related features seem good how they are right now. Various little tweaks have been made here and there by Sony, and most that I can see are either optional or beneficial to the user. The ability to disable and customize things like side sense and the dynamic vibration are awesome and I'm so glad Sony gives the option for this rather than forcing it upon users. I would appreciate seeing this in a few other places however such as with adaptive charging, like manually setting a wake up time instead of my phone trying (and failing) to automatically predict when I will wake up. Finally night mode was added! My poor crippled eyes can finally experience that comforting warm hue when I'm staying up past my bed time.
  The battery is as good or better than most other offerings out there today. I am almost always able to squeeze out two days of usage from my Sony phones without recharging, and I'd consider myself a medium to heavy user but I do actively try to save battery by reducing brightness, closing apps and turning on stamina mode when needed. Stamina mode is great and ultra stamina mode is great for Bear Grylls. Unfortunately there isn't a fast charger included in the box, just a regular charger. I usually recharge overnight anyway but it is kind of a bummer that I don't feel like a super elite first class dude with the best stuff after spending near a grand on a phone. Battery Care is a nice feature from Sony in a world where most other phone companies are treating their lithium ion filled phablets like a disposable Kodak camera.
  Next up is the screen. My previous phone was the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, which I thought had an amazing display, and it did, but this phone kicked that up a couple notches. When I started watching videos on this phone with maxed out resolution it felt like the first time I saw a 4K TV on display at Best Buy. I feel really lame admitting this but I got goosebumps. Whatever it could have been cold in my house I'm not sure. It is great to look at though, seeing the screen in person is the only way that you will experience the perfection of this screen. Colors look excellent to me, everything just pops in a realistic way. Nothing really seems washed out or overexposed. Sony did a fantastic job calibrating this. I haven't used a Note 9 or iPhone XS yet so I can't comment on which one is better but I'd feel confident in saying Samsung and Apple have some very tough competition. One thing I will say about the screen is that it looks slightly blue on the curved sections, but this doesn't necessarily apply when watching videos, only when viewing a white screen, so it's not a huge complaint from me as it isn't intrusive or distracting.
  Sound. Wow this phone kicks! After unboxing the phone I turned up the volume all the way and started watching a video and it was actually loud! Surprisingly, I turned it down. I was surprised again later in the day when I was using the phone for GPS and the speakers were able to surpass the road noise from driving on the highway which I don't think I've ever experienced in a phone before. The Dynamic Vibration System is an interesting experience, and I think with a little bit of tweaking and reduction of latency, Sony might have something cool on their hands. I'd find myself sort of missing it when I turned it off, because in the lowest setting it feels like it adds bass to the phone, even if it doesn't in reality. The subtle sound based vibration isn't going to radically alter your media consumption but hey at least Sony is trying new stuff! Obviously this phone is missing the auxiliary port which to some aux snobs is probably a turn off. The only time I use my aux is when I'm in the car and feeling auxy but even then that isn't very often so this just comes down to personal preference. I think dongles are lame but hey whatever it doesn't really apply to me so I can't tell you how it should apply to yourself.
  The camera is kind of the typical bag of Sony goodies. You have the super slowmo 960 FPS at 1080p I believe and the 4k HDR video recording. What they offer is on par with most other high end phones. I haven't extensively tested the camera so I don't want to jump to any conclusions. What I do know is that Sony hasnt reinvented the smartphone camera here yet. You still get very good shots that are quite situational. In good light with a steady hand your shots will look good. With hands as shaky as the Dynamic Vibration system on this phone and a night darker than the perfect blacks on this phone's OLED screen, your picture is going to look like some soup. I'll probably come back and update this part of the review once I go outside and experience nature in more than one light setting.
  Some of my other thoughts on this phone include other bits about the Sony ecosystem and the actual experience of living with the phone. Sony phones have always held up well to time in my experience, more so than any other phone brands I've tried, including Apple, Samsung, HTC, LG and even Pixel phones. I have the same high expectations for this phone. I enjoy the apps Sony has preloaded, such as the album app and music app. It actually gives you an option upon the very first startup on whether you want to install certain other apps (or bloatware depending on who you are) which is pretty cool! I installed most of them because it was stuff like the Playstation app and Amazon that I'm going to use anyway. I really wish Sony would do more with this phone in terms of Playstation compatability. You do have the option of PS4 remote play, which works good with a great internet connection, but I believe there is so much more innovation and opportunity waiting to happen between the Playstation and Sony Mobile teams! Okay now to the part of living with this phone and probably the biggest criticism from me. I have a sneaking suspicion that the whole country known as the United States of America is like a red-headed step child to Sony Mobile. In this metaphor they provide us with a roof over our heads and some food, but not much else. In the US it is highly unlikely that you will find XZ3 cases or screen protectors in your local electronic store, and your cell phone provider will most likely look at you like a fool when you let them know that Sony does indeed make phones. Have fun importing the official Sony style cases to the US if you want them, or maybe even the cool wireless charging stand that is sold in currencies that don't have a $ before them. I really really want this phone to be my perfect phone but it doesn't support Wi-Fi calling. This is a huge miscalculation by whoever made the decision, be it T-mobile or Sony or some higher diety. If you have set foot inside the US then you most likely know it's the land of the free and home of the sprawling empty area outside of cities that has little to no cell reception. I have literally had better reception in rural Thailand than in the middle of the second biggest city in my state, so WiFi calling should be as necessary to phones in 2018 as a fingerprint sensor (I would gladly give up the sensor for Wi-Fi calling BTW). This being said, if you need a phone that can be a means of communication above all else, I do not believe the XZ3 is for you. It really pains me to say that because this phone does so many things right, but the one area it lacks in is the main thing phones are used for, communication. That being said, cell reception is good and I haven't noticed anything wonky in the areas I normally get reception.

  To summarize my points, this is an excellent phone, but there are quite a few other excellent phones out there. This is one of the few phones that is hard to complain about if you're an average (or anything other than average) phone user. If you like Sony phones, or well designed tech, you're going to love this phone. If you have an issue with losing out on Wi-Fi calling or VoLTE, you should probably skip this phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Overall a Great Phone;"Pros:
1. The screen is ABSOLUTE GORGEOUS, I own Samsung Note 9 and Xs Max, the screen on this Sony is unbeatable. Sony used a newer technology to produce their screen and it is looking fantastic.
2. Doesn't wobble that much on the desk comparing to XZ2.
3. VoLTE is working for T-Mobile (I wan't able to test on other carriers).
4. Comes with Android 9 out of the box.
5. Front facing camera is amazing with much clearer pictures comparing to XZ2, even better than Xs Max.
6. Very sleek design and it has NO NOTCH!!
7. Front facing speakers sounds really good comparing to Note 9.
8. Dedicated camera button instead of a Bixby button.

Cons:
1. Fingerprint scanner is still a bit awkwardly placed.
2. Even though it comes with Android 9, the gesture control like on the new Pixel 3 phones is removed. (I personally don't care since the gesture control is really awkward anyway)
3. Even though it packs a 3300mAh battery, I have less battery percentage after a day of use comparing to Xs Max, but it does hold me through a day. (I have 6 hours of screen on time; I watch YouTube videos, play games, and scroll through social media apps like Facebook and Instagram.)
4. Headphone jack is gone forever for flagship phones from Sony (I use their bluetooth headphones and LDAC is great on playing my FLAC files through bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me.)

Conclusion:
This is really a great phone from Sony. They improved this phone from XZ2 in all of the aspects. Awesome display, great front facing speakers, and great cameras. The battery life is average to good comparing to other flagships in 2018, but it still is able to hold me through a day, so I have so complaints here. Sony is the only company out there still adding a dedicated camera button, and I have to say, I love it. If you are looking out there for a great phone from Sony, this is a really nice option even if it costs $900 (I pre-ordered it with the Ear Duo bundle, but I would still buy it for $900 for phone only).";F.H;18-Oct-18;;screen,screen,carriers,camera,pictures,speakers,sounds,camera,button,button,fingerprint,scanner,gesture,control,phones,gesture,control,battery,percentage,screen,time,videos,games,media,headphone,jack,phones,bluetooth,headphones,files,bluetooth,phone,phone,display,speakers,cameras,battery,camera,button,phone,phone;1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
5.0 out of 5 stars;Personal 10/10, would recommend to others.;This phone has exceeded my expectations.  I bought it after thorough research and it definitely lived up to the hype.

5.0 out of 5 stars;FANTASTIC screen, UI is flawless, Fast, Ease of use;"I hardly do product review, but this one I feel the need to.
People always go for Samsung or Apple, but i""m the opposite.  I go for quality and not those expensive junk.
I just got this phone and I'm so glad I did.  The green one is really nice.  It feels premium in your hand and it's easy to hold.  Here are some of the things I love about this phone.

-The screen is AMAZING.
-The OS is so easy to navigate.  It's the simplest Android you will find out there
-The phone itself is very fast
-Fingerprint is at the back which some have to get use to, but it's very fast and accurate to turn on the phone.
-The camera takes great pictures
-The sound quality of the music you play is rich and please to your ears

I have always use Sony phone despite of whatever anyone say.  Quality is quality.  They don't make product that will blow up on the plane (Samsung) or recently recall one of their product (also Samsung).
You can't beat a Japanese when it comes to technology.

I would highly recommended this phone.";Scoobydoo;3-May-19;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-XZ3-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07H6VBGJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,phone,screen,phone,-fingerprint,camera,phone,music,pictures,phone,phone;1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great phone;"Overwhelming pleased with the XZ3. A beautiful designed phone that fits well in my hands and stands out from the crowd.

Pros
Nice clear, bright, and sharp display. Able to see in bright sunlight environment.

A bit longer than any phone I’ve ever had and that seems to make it fit better in my hands.

Front camera is a single 19 MP, f/2.0, 25mm camera. I’ve had great results in all lighting conditions with the front camera. More contrast and HDR look to images than other phones I’ve used. Great for 4K video as well. Selfie camera is single 13 MP, f/1.9, 23mm camera. Works well in most lighting conditions.

Finger print scanner on the back works fast and is in a good location for my hands. Also come with multi touch screen.

Build quality is excellent. Feels like quality in your hand.

Comes with lastedAndroid OS Pie

Speakers are the best I’ve heard on any mobile device. Even ones 10 times the size. Also has the vibration sound assist which is a brilliant idea and makes the sound that much better.

Comes with non-removable Li-Ion 3300 mAh battery that lasts for a long time. Easily last me the day with light to moderate use.

Cons
No audio jack. A trend among all manufacturers these day.

I think portrait mode suffers from not having 2 front cameras. Portraits I have seen on other flagship phones are better.

Side sense is annoying but easy to turn off.";Joseph Oppenheim;27-Oct-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-XZ3-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07H6VBGJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,display,phone,camera,camera,camera,images,phones,video,camera,camera,print,scanner,location,screen,speakers,vibration,sound,battery,sound,time,cameras,phones;1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;Gorgeous OLED screen!!;All I can is wow!! This is my first Sony phone and I absolutely love it. The screen is the best I've ever seen on a phone before. I'm coming from a LG V30 and with that device, I felt like I could never get the screen comfortable enough for my eyes. It was either too bright or too dark.. But with this OLED screen everything is bright, punchy, and clear right out of the box! Now I'll admit the lack of headphone jack put me off at first, however it comes with adapter in the box which is great and very helpful. I'll say this though be prepared to update multiple times. I believe I restarted and went through 5 or 6 Xperia updates before I was up to calendar. However if you love Sony like I do, would like a phone with a beautiful screen that's great for traveling and watching Netflix on.. Then get this!

5.0 out of 5 stars;Gorgeous Screen, Stock Android Experience;"The best feature of this phone is how standard it is.  It's a standard Android experience without a bunch of modifications.  Sure Sony includes some bundled apps, but they can all be removed.

The sound and picture quality is outstanding.  I've got a little movie studio in my hands.  It's got most of the features you'd expect from the latest phones like qi charging, USB-C,  and fingerprint unlock.  Thank you for including a headphone jack converter!

As a phone, it works just like you'd expect.  The sound and battery life is pretty standard.  Unfortunately, it's single-SIM, but other models do support dual-SIM.

My one concern is because it's not a very popular phone, I've had trouble getting a case for it.";Dave Greenbaum;26-Dec-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-XZ3-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07H6VBGJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,sound,picture,phones,fingerprint,unlock,headphone,phone,battery,phone;1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;Mostly great;"You will be impressed with the awesome screen on this phone.  And the sound is quite impressive as well.  The fingerprint scanner works more reliably than what I've had on other phones, e.g. when my fingers are a little wet.  Overall the quality of pretty much every detail is high.

The performance of the camera in low light surprised me.  I went into a room dark enough that I would definitely want to turn on the light (overcast day with blinds closed) and took a picture.  It used a long exposure, and the resulting photo looks like I took it on a normal day.  This was without a tripod; I was just holding the camera (still) in my hands, so I'm assuming that image stabilization helped out.  I'm used to quite the opposite, that in low light photos are far worse than what I see with my eyes.

Also, someone complained about the lack of WiFi calling.  If you have Google Voice, you can make calls over WiFi on this phone -- it works great.  And if you don't already know about Google Voice, you're missing out; get it and enjoy WiFi calling.

I see tons of complaints about the fingerprint scanner being too low, but I think I know why they put it where they did, and it makes sense to me.  On my old phone the scanner was higher, close to the camera, and the camera *always* had fingerprints on it.  On this phone, the scanner is right in the center, so if you register your fingerprints from the side you can easily find the scanner and spare the camera.  You'll only be unhappy with the placement of the scanner if you insist on coming at it from the bottom.

The curved back has plusses and minuses.  On the plus side, it feels really good in the hand, because you are not holding the phone just by the edges -- more of the back surface makes contact with your hand.  That also makes it less likely to slip out of your hand.  However, what is good for your hand is bad for everything else -- when you put the phone on a flat surface, it is resting on just a point.  I have had the phone slide off of a surface that I thought was flat and hit the floor.  I took that as a warning, so now a phone case is on the way.

I'm still on the fence about Sony's ""Side-Sense"" feature.  It's handy when it works, but I seem to have trouble invoking it when I want it, and too often it comes up when I didn't mean for it to.  I'm giving it a few weeks to decide whether I should just disable it.

One of my favorite things about the camera is that it is water-resistant.  The last phone I bought began a slow decline after I got caught by surprise with some rain.  I immediately put the camera (which was in a silicone case) in my pocket, but my pants got damp.  The video on the phone started acting weird the next day, and over the next month or so it eventually gave out, rendering the phone useless.  With the XZ3 I won't have to worry about that kind of thing -- there's an AndroidPit video on YouTube in which a guy runs an XZ3 (that is capturing video) through a dishwasher cycle.

Overall an awesome phone.  You'll love the gorgeous display.";Nicholas Sterling;11-Nov-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-XZ3-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07H6VBGJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews;screen,phone,fingerprint,sound,scanner,phones,fingers,camera,picture,camera,image,stabilization,wifi,voice,calls,wifi,phone,voice,fingerprint,scanner,sense,phone,scanner,camera,camera,fingerprints,phone,scanner,fingerprints,scanner,camera,scanner,phone,phone,phone,phone,camera,phone,camera,video,phone,phone,video,video,phone,display,-,screen,phone,sound,fingerprint,scanner,phones,camera,picture,camera,image,stabilization,photos,wifi,voice,calls,wifi,phone,voice,fingerprint,scanner,phone,scanner,camera,camera,fingerprints,phone,scanner,fingerprints,scanner,camera,scanner,phone,phone,camera,phone,camera,video,phone,phone,video,video,phone,display;1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;Sony Xperia XZ3;The Sony Xperia XZ3 is really an amazing Cell Phone. My only complaint is with Sony, why, because the Xperia XZ3 Lens is constructed using Gorilla Temper Glass 5. Well, my phone had fallen out of my shirt pocket when bent over which was about waist high, needless to say, the lens cracked. I called Sony told them of the situation and their response was, they would repair the lens for $250.00 plus shipping. Now, to my understanding Gorilla Temper Glass 5 has a drop ratio from shoulder high. My phone was and still in a case designed specifically for the Xperia XZ3 and the glass still cracked. So, if you carry your phone in your top pocket, beware - because if it does fall and the lens crack Sony is the only one in the position to change the lens out. No company here in the US will repair or replace the Sony Xperia XZ3.;Kindle Customer;31-Mar-19;;phone,phone,lens,phone,phone;1,1,1,1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Xperia with band 12 VoLTE on Tmobile support;"I enjoy the OLED screen.  Edge sense is an interesting function I am playing with where app icons pop up when you touch the edge of the screen.  This supports band 12 and VoLTE on T-Mobile which is not common on Xperia.  I preferred the fingerprint scanner on the side, on the back is a little awkward.  Qi charging is nice, make sure to get a case that will not interfere.  I chose this over the XZ2 premium mainly due to the band 12 with VoLTE on Tmobile and the OLED which the XZ2 Premium does not have but I was tempted by the XZ2 Premium dual camera. As is typical of glass body the phone is a little slippery so a case would be a good idea.

I got it with the Xperia Ear Duo which I enjoy but it is not for everyone. The duo on purpose lets one hear sound around you which is great for biking or walking etc. but would not block out any noise on a train, a plane or any other environment with a lot of noise.  I found the sound a little bit low in some cases.  The assistant is interesting, I enjoy it but it is not for everyone.  The battery of the ear duo lasts nearly 4 hours but the case has a battery that can recharge the ear duo.";C.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Gorgeous;Overall a great experience. The phone itself is beautiful and feels like you're holding a gem or magic crystal of some sort. It's made of glass and just beautiful. The screen is gorgeous. Definitely prefer it over my S9 for videos and pictures because it is crystal clear and just gorgeous. It's like having a mini 4K tv in the palm of your hand. Android platform is well laid out, as well as the Sony layout in general. This is my first experience with a Sony phone, so I wasnt sure what to expect. It's very easy to use and to get used to. Everything just makes sense. Its easy to find what you want and do what you want. If you use your phone for heavy entertainment purposes - movies, pics, videos, music.. - this is the phone to get. It's an entertainment work horse with plenty of ram, too.;MyPenName;18-Dec-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-XZ3-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07H6VBGJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,screen,videos,pictures,phone,phone,movies,phone,videos,pics,ram;1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;Best Phone ever!;I have had this since the end of October and the phone is still absolutely fantastic.  It blows away the quality of my past Samsung S7 & S9.  I have owned Sony phones in the past, HTC, Motorola, Samsung, Asus, iPhone, & LG.  The XZ3 surpasses all of them.  I will never use any other brand of phone besides Sony from now on.  The screen quality is top notch, the camera is really great.  One of my friends that just got the iphone x is amazed and how much better the Sony camera is compared to his iphone.  The phone is very fluid and snappy and the battery lasts me on an average work day with moderate use from 6am until 10pm with about 20-30% battery remaining.  The fact that it vibrates to music is a little strange and can fortunately be turned off.  The fingerprint sensor is extremely fast to react.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Super fast Android phone;"This is a high end Android phone from Sony. Sony does not have a lot of phone distribution in the US, and it's too bad given that this Xperia phone is very, very nice. I would say it is a nicer piece of hardware than my son's iPhone X. Some of the things I liked:

1. Very nicely finished. The craftsmanship is on par with anything out there.
2. Wrap around screen with edge sense short cuts - much like Samsung high end phones.
3. Really fast processor. I still like my iPhones, but this thing feels twice as zippy.
4. Fingerprint sensor on the back side. Good idea.
5. No crashes, no hassles getting it going.
6. Fast boot from cold start.
7. Multi day battery life - about 2x the life of my iPhone.
8. USB C connector - enter the modern age.
9. Sharp camera, but needs some post production color correction, IMO.
10. Awesomely good looking screen. I shot a photo of the screen and posted it to show how the screen is a ""retina-like"" imaging device. Maybe better.

Middling issues.
1. The camera is nice, but I don't think the color balance is as good as on my iPhone. The Xperia colors are too vivid and the iPhone is more natural to my eyes.
2. Uh, it's Android and that means you have a certain amount of arranging to do before it becomes super useful. I've never liked Android as much as iOS. I can use it, but then again I've used RT-11, VMS, DOS and Unix 4.x BSD ... I don't value the total control aspect as much as others do. I just want to get going and the ""total customization""opportunity of Android, I find t be an obligation. Not the phone's fault, though.

Cons
1. None significant.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Not my favorite Xperia;"Let me say up front that we're an Xperia family - I just moved from the XZ1 to the XZ3, and my daughter just went from the XZ Compact to the XZ Compact 2. So it hurts me a little to say it, but I don't like the XZ3 nearly as much as the XZ1.

What's good:
- The quality is flagship worthy. The screen is beautiful, the cameras are great, and I assume it's at least as waterproof as my XZ1 was. (And my XZ1 spent 4 hours 15 feet down in the ocean and started working as soon as we found it and brought it back up!)
- The battery is pretty good, and even for a heavy user like me, lasts a full day as long as I'm not running Waze.

What could be better
- As beautiful as the phone is, there is no way to use it without a case. It has curved sides and a glass back, and I just guarantee it will slip sooner or later.
- Instead of the nice wide buttons of the XZ1, the XZ3 has super skinny buttons (apparently made to fit the curved sides) that are much harder to press, especially if the phone is in a case, which, as stated, its design basically requires. As much as I love having a dedicated camera button, I feel like I need to press it with my fingernail to reliably hit it, which removes a lot of the convenience. (It can also be hard to hit the volume button correctly, and I've already accidentally turned on assisted mode twice!)
- I really liked having a fingerprint scanner in the power button. I'm learning to use the one on the back, but it's sort of begging for me to miss and get my greasy fingers all over the nearby camera lens.

Overall, it's a beautiful and powerful phone, but the design choices ultimately make it less functional than my old XZ1.";Joseph91;19-Nov-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-XZ3-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07H6VBGJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews;screen,cameras,battery,phone,buttons,buttons,phone,button,camera,volume,button,mode,fingerprint,scanner,power,button,camera,phone;1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

4.0 out of 5 stars;Stunning, especially in green or red.;Always been a Sony fan. This XZ3 is definitely a step up from previous phones they've released. One of the common issues I read about I think is over stated. The location of the finger print sensor isn't an issue at all for me. I just hold the phone from the bottom and the sensor is right where my finger lands. The image quality of the camera to me is just average. I know there are many adjustments and I'm sure I could tweak it to be great. Just that comparing it to my S8 right out of the box isn't too impressive. I also miss the time lapse option. Great phone altogether though, premium materials and build quality, the green and red versions are STUNNING!

5.0 out of 5 stars;For the price of admission, a real knockout;"Summary: This is a prestige style option that feels unparalleled in the hand and sports an industry-leading screen - if that is what is important to you, this is the phone of your dreams, and the few minor complaints will be entirely acceptable.

Pros:
* Gorgeous design. The Forest Green color is incredibly attractive and gives handsome variation in tone in different lighting. While Sony has moved into a curved world, the monolithic lines of the profile (including the very narrow corners) remain and remind me of what I loved about the Z1 Compact. The 2:1 aspect ratio makes this phone more slender than most. The glossy black finish of the front with the curved edges is really something else. This is what sold me and I have not been disappointed.
* Excellent materials. The contour of the glass is incredibly pleasing in the hand, as is the thin aluminum frame. While some have different opinions on glass backs, the full glass coverage mitigates some of the slipperiness of the phone's curved edges by providing grip - something I missed with the magnesium back of the Pixel. The design may have sold me, but the feel of the phone in the hand is what's confirming the decision.
* OLED screen. Fantastic quality, insane DPI, it's very clear this is the same tech Sony uses in its Bravia screens. I wouldn't have come back to Sony without this.
* Great camera. Works well in many different lighting scenarios.
* Snappy processor. I haven't noticed any slowdown and new games/apps work perfectly well. I'm not a huge gamer though so other reviews might cover this better than I will.
* Fingerprint scanner. For many, the low rear placement has been a con. For those of us with smaller hands, it's a godsend, plain and simple.
* Dedicated camera button. I missed you!
* No notch. If you like notches, flip this to the con category!

Neutral
* Picks up fingerprints easily. On the other hand, they wipe off easily. Since it's so gorgeous when wiped clean, hard to call this a big winner or loser.

Cons
* Slippery. Will slide off of angled surfaces. This is mitigated in the hand by the glass. So while I feel secure not putting this phone in a case, I need to be cognizant of where I put it down.
* No headphone jack. This was a hard reality for me to come to, but when I'm out and about I'm using bluetooth and when I'm home I can plug in the USB-C to use my fancy headphones.
* Weak battery - I make it through the day with email, news, a few minutes of fire emblem/youtube, but not by much.
* Expensive. Sony seems to be pricing to make up for weak sales in the US. Maybe they got a few more bucks from me, but I'm not convinced it's a winning strategy.";Jcto;6-Nov-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-XZ3-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07H6VBGJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews;option,screen,phone,phone,glass,glass,phone,design,phone,screen,quality,screens,camera,games/apps,gamer,scanner,camera,button,notch,notches,fingerprints,phone,headphone,jack,bluetooth,headphones,battery;1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;OLED screen at 1440p, Waterproof, Dustproof and SD card!;"It comes with a 3.5mm usb-c dongle.

I purchased this phone to replace my old Nexus 5. I selected this smartphone because of its beautiful screen. Watching high quality videos on this smart phone will immerse you completely in the video. However outside of video watching, the phone needs to be calibrated to suit you:

I turned off side sense because it is a feature that I don't need.
I had to enable the zoom in feature because it was disabled
I had to enable moving apps from the app storage sceen to the main screen
I had to disable the always on screen feature
Enabling to auto rotate on the home screen seems to make the phone rotate from portrait to landscape a lot quicker
The camera on the phone works better in Manual mode vesus Auto
I think I will turn on the glove mode because sometimes the screen doesnt recognize my taps
I the phone will automatically close unused/idle apps

I am happy with this phone because of its beautiful screen!
There are other features on the phone that I haven't tried and will try them out as the situation dictates.
Also, this phone is super fast!

The Xperia Duo is great for listening to music when you want to be aware of your surroundings.
Voice chat on the Xperia duo was horrible, the sound quality was horrible and It wouldn't stay connected for long phone calls
The control features of the Xperia Duo such as swipping or head nodding is not responsive

3.0 out of 5 stars;A mixed bag. Not a 5.7 inch screen;"This phone is a mixed bag. On paper, the specs look good and it seems to run fast. However, the biggest issue that I have with the phone is its screen. Sony claims that the phone has a 5.7 inch screen. NOT TRUE. The useable screen is only 5.3 inch. So if you are looking for a 5.3 inch screen, this may be your phone. If you need something bigger, move on.

Currently own a Samsung Note 4. It has a true 5.7 inch screen. Measuring the width and the height of the screen you get about 7.1 x 12.6 cm = 89.46 sqcm of useable screen space. My iPhone 6s plus has 83.64 sqcm of screen space. And now this Sony XZ2 : 6.5 x 11.6 cm = 75.4 sqcm of usable screen space. You loose a lot of real estate. Can't afford this, need this phone for business  to read documents, emails, etc. so I need to screen space.";M S Frank;29-Aug-18; ;phone,phone,screen,phone,screen,screen,screen,phone,screen,phone,emails,documents;1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

3.0 out of 5 stars;Marginal improvement from XZs;"Beware whom you get this phone from!!!
The more I use this phone, the more I feel that this phone was a demo unit.
- screen touch isn't responsive
- periodic lines appears when hands are warm
- auto brightness is close to not working

Updated thoughts:
I think xperia xz2 is generally a good phone. However, after seeing the complaints, it makes me wonder if third party sellers are getting their phones from defected batches from the manufacturers (not Sony). That's why they are much cheaper than the market value. I'll buy it from best buy directly to see if there are fewer issues.

New found issue:
As many people would do after the screen is full of fingerprints and dusty, we wipe it with cloth or our clothes. After that, you will see very obvious horizontal lines due to ESD. Not sure if this is my phone or it's a general issue. I have to restart the phone to get rid of the lines.
Also, if you finger swipe quickly and create some static, you will see the color gets darker... Very disappointed

Upgraded from xperia xzs...
Have been a Sony fan... However, somehow a bit disappointed by the phone. But let's start with the good stuff though:

1. Great LCD screen, good color, but light leakage is a bit worse than my xzs.
2. Good low light performance camera. However, I think they over increased the pixel gain. As a result, during normal light condition, noise is higher.
3. Battery life is improved, probably just because it's bigger.
4. Beautiful design (black) without a case
5. Speaker is louder

Now, the bad stuff:
1. Fingerprint sensor location is awkward. After upgrading to Android 9, it became less responsive and some Apps stopped working with the sensor.
2. Slippery without a case.
3. Nice haptic engine, but the force is too small to feel when there is a phone call.
4. A bit on the heavier side as for the weight.
5. Pictures from the front camera are very nosiy
6. Sony needs to make a SW to stop all the Google stuff that's running in the background. That's why the bigger battery doesn't improve the user experience that much
7. Battery care option doesn't seem to work on my phone

My wish list for xz4...
1. Don't use oled... It's the stupidest technology... Shorter life time, burn in problem... Maybe save the battery life marginally
2. Keep the fingerprint sensor on the Side!!! Under display fp sensor is overrated. People will see burn in in their oled with optical fp sensors
3. Make a better SW.
4. Have a option in the camera so that images are less noisy in normal lighting
5. If you want to do a glass back for wireless charge, use frosted glass so that it's not a fingerprint magnet or scratch-happy surface";Nick;19-Dec-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-5-7-inches-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07BGXVDZP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,phone,phone,screen,touch,auto,brightness,phone,phones,people,screen,fingerprints,phone,phone,color,phone,screen,lcd,color,performance,camera,battery,speaker,fingerprint,sensor,location,sensor,slippery,engine,phone,call,pictures,camera,battery,battery,option,phone,technology,time,battery,fingerprint,sensor,display,sensor,sensors,option,camera,images,wireless,charge;0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here in the states I think only 2 carriers can work with this phone AT&T for sure ( I had to switch to this carrier for this phone) and I believe the other is Verizon.;Francisco;14-Jul-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-5-7-inches-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07BGXVDZP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,features,phone,carriers,phone,phone;1,1,1,1,1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;Highest quality feel of any phone I've ever tried other than xperia xz3;High quality phone, better than any other android phone to my knowledge excluding the newly released xz3. The screen is actually really good when compared to oleds side by sude even though it's an lcd screen which was surping. The speakers are also incredible for a phone. I know this phone still has bezels but I don't mind them because I actually have a place to grip it when watching movies unlike the iphone x wich sometimes falls because I have to be careful not to touch the screen. Also the fingerprint sensor for my not so big hands is perfectly placed and I have had no problems mistaking the camera for the fingerprint sensor.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Battery Life, Good Camera, Buttery-smooth Operation, with the Usual Sprinkle of Pre-installed Crapware;"Great battery life is what I look for in every phone that I buy. This one lasts me 1.5 to 2 days on a full charge—and I usually only charge it up to 95%. The phone UI is pretty smooth. Even with battery time preferred STAMINA mode (which I keep on most of the time), the phone feels quite responsive.

I can’t say much about the camera other than that it takes pictures much better than the Xperia Z5 Compact that I have. The photos just come out with more detail. It’s not as good as SAMSUNG or Apple’s iPhone though—which is weird considering the fact that Sony makes great DSLRs and camera sensors.

A little warning for those who do not like pre-installed crapware: this phone is heavy on the Amazon pre-installed apps and Facebook which cannot be removed—only disabled. I use Amazon services, but I do not want separate apps hogging storage space on my phone. I prefer the much less intrusive option of using a web browser. Among the list of crapware that I’ve had to disable: Amazon Shopping, Amazon Kindle, AVG Protection, Facebook, Facebook App Installer, Facebook App Manager, Facebook Services, Lounge, and Prime Video. At least they removed File Commander and Spotify (which were pre-installed on previous phones).";Kevin L.;13-Jun-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-5-7-inches-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07BGXVDZP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;battery,phone,charge,phone,ui,battery,time,stamina,mode,time,phone,camera,pictures,photos,camera,sensors,warning,phone,services,apps,storage,space,phone,option,web,browser,app,services,video,file,phones;1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
5.0 out of 5 stars;A unique flagship phone doesn't cost you that much.;I initially bought this phone for it 960 fps fhd slowmo camera. After using it for six month , I found out it is a great smart phone for 500 dollars. It has a good battery ,a nice screen with good color accuracy, and a strong sp845 processing power. The only downside it is the touch accuracy and speaker bass. I hope Sony will increase the touch accuracy by software updates.

5.0 out of 5 stars;The first truly awesome Sony smartphone;"This is my fifth Sony. Literally all other Androids offend my sense of style, they are just fuckly. So I always ended up getting Sonys for their black, clean, angular lines and that awesome side-mounted fingerprint sensor. However, I did so knowing full well that they were technologically mediocre compared to Samsung and some other brands. However, I just hate Samsungs styling and they way they rape Android.

With the XZ2 things changed. I was, and still am, a little disappointed that Sony dropped the side-mounted fingerprint sensor. But except for that, this phone is excellent. The screen is great, it is super fast and smooth. Great camera. Battery is miles better than on any previous model. Last but not least, it looks fantastic (people actually peek at it wondering what it is) and it also feels great to hold.

I've had the phone for three weeks now, and I actually enjoy it a little more every day.";Arne Wolframm;12-Jun-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-5-7-inches-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07BGXVDZP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;fingerprint,sensor,fingerprint,sensor,phone,screen,camera,battery,phone;1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;Great phone with outstanding camera;"Great phone. I have it since a couple of months and I will buy another one for my wife. The camera is the most important feature on a smartphone for me and in this point it is probably the best device on the market right now.
I compared photos from the same scene from an iPhone X and a S9+ and the Sony brings higher resolution and better colors even in low light conditions.
What also convinced me was the display, which beats Apple and Samsung in max. brightness. It's not an OLED display which means less contrast and a noticeable black level but it has a higher color fidelity and more natural colors, which I find more important (personal opinion).

On the negative side it is a little thicker and heavier than the competitors.

The build quality of the phone is great and it feels very solid. Some people complain about the location of the finger print reader, which I can't understand. I have no problems finding it and it works great.

All in all the flagship phones are all very close together and the decision to choose one over the other is down to details. I had Sony and Samsung phones before. Here the decision was for the camera and that the Sony phones I had so far were a little more stable in software and survived very long even so I don't treat my phones very carefully.";xSTONE;29-Jul-18;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-5-7-inches-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07BGXVDZP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,camera,feature,smartphone,device,photos,scene,resolution,colors,display,brightness,display,color,fidelity,colors,phone,location,reader,print,phones,phones,camera,phones,software,phones;1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;A flagship phone that won't break the bank;Is this phone cheap? No. Is this phone overly expensive? Also no. It's got a great headphone jack with a custom quad DAC chip built into the phone co-developed between ESS and LG. It will drive your higher end headphones well. It has google assistant built in. It has a decent size battery and all the latest doodads to charge it including quick charge and QI wireless charging. The processor puts it on equal footing with the S9+. Also it has this nice new feature where you can use it to place telephone calls. Crazy what they can do with technology these days.;Jason Mueller;21-Dec-18;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews;headphonejack,headphones,battery,feature;1,1,1,1

2.0 out of 5 stars;Useless camera. Back 10 years in technology.;Although I was not expecting the best camera out there, I did not expect such a low quality image capture. Speed is extremely slow, making any slight move a blur. AI seems to be built to mess your photo instead of helping. Go manual for better result, but remember that shutter speed will limit your quality due to extremely low processing.;Leonardo B Grodetzky;10-Feb-19;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews;image,speed;0,0

5.0 out of 5 stars;Love Everything About This Phone Really Fun!;"I got this phone as a present and really love it. Was able to try this and some of it's competitors in a store to see how each felt in my hand, how easy was it to handle, how good was the display and I took photos of the some object (my husband) at the same distance with each one.

I take quite a few pictures so I was happy so the final determiner for me was the clarity of the pictures and quality of the color without using filters.  Call quality is splendid.  Display is so great I don't even have to use my reading glasses.
And the different features are very fun and easy to use.

Great processor as well.";C. Appel;25-Oct-18;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews;display,picture,color,features,processor;1,2,2,1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;Best phone I've had so far!;"Before I start my review, I would like to mention that my previous phones were the Iphone 5, Samsung Galaxy S7, and a Samsung Galaxy S9.  I will use the Galaxy S9 for a couple of examples since it’s the last phone I had (and my wife still has hers).  Alright, hold on tight for this one because I got inspired lol…

PROS:
SCREEN - The first thing that with catch your attention is the screen.  This screen is colorful, sharp, bright, and very attractive to the eye.  It has a feature I’ve never seen on any other phone where it can boost the screen brightness at a very high level so its easy to use when on direct sunlight.  Also, its flat which means no weird edge screen like the Galaxy S9 (this means no screen glare on the corners and tempered glass screen protectors are compatible).
CAMERA – The camera is very impressive with nice color enhancements.  The COOLEST feature is the wide-angle lens.  Its not a fisheye like the gopro, but it lets you take incredible photos from a very close distance.
BATTERY – yeah, I have no idea why people complain about the battery of this phone.  Maybe is because they pay too much attention to the hardware.  The truth is the phone lasts the entire day with absolutely no problem.  I feel the battery performance is as good (if not better) than the Galaxy S9.
FACE RECOGNITION – The face recognition is fast…very fast.  You don’t have to find the perfect angle or wait for it to unlock.  I find it to unlock in 1 second or less.
SOUND – The sound its loud, clear, but when placed on a table it has no competition.  It really beats the phones out there.

CONS:
CAMERA – Although the camera in general way better than the Samsung Galaxy S9, night photography (front camera) with the S9 turns out to be slightly better.  This is because the S9 has double aperture.
SIDE BUTTON – This phone includes an extra button that activates google now.  I do not use google now so it would be nice to be able to use this button as another shortcut such as camera, email, or any other thing.";Roffoc;1-Aug-18;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews;screen,camera,battery,recognition,sound;1,1,1,1,1
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Alternative to Galaxy/iPhone;Purchased through Verizon not Amazon, but am very happy with this phone.  It replaced my droid turbo 2.  I did a lot of research first and am happy I did.  It's quick, has a great quality screen, takes nice pics (even in low light), and is very customizable and user friendly.  Glad it still has a headphone jack and SD slot.  Battery life is not unbelievable, but it seems comparable with all the other major models out there now.  Also, sound quality is a little disappointing - the loud end really loses quality and sounds tinny.  But overall, I would recommend to a friend and would purchase again myself.;Kate Monroe;16-Dec-18;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,screen,headphone,battery,sound;1,1,1,1,0
2.0 out of 5 stars;Phone sucks!!;Returned phone with in few days! Camera locks up when taking pictures. Have completely go out of camera mode then return. By then subject is missed. Freezes when typing. People cant hear me alot or me hear. Have to turn phone practically up your nose and cover face. Things seem to just dissappear like icons and pictures go to different places.

Now getting the g6 wich i should have gotten!!! Now i have to pay restock fee and tax again!!! Hate this phone. Had my daughter try it. She hates it to. She has the 6. For the price....no!!!

1.0 out of 5 stars;I feel totally ripped off by LG, Never again!;"Last year LG made a big deal about how they were going to update their phones in a timely manner. This could not be further from the truth. Here we are in Q2 of 2019 and this phone is still on Android 8 (not even 8.1).

Coming from a pure Android before that got updates within a few months, this is a huge disappointment. LG Android customizations are more annoying than useful and hardly outweigh the new features that Android 9 has. I would gladly go to a stock Android OS if it meant they could roll out an update in a timely manner.

LG spends all of their resources making new phones (who else has 2 ""flagship"" phones at the same time that are so similar it's difficult to tell them apart?) instead of updating the phones they have and wonders why their Mobile devision is failing.";CD;3-Apr-19;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,customization,phone;2,0,0

4.0 out of 5 stars;I love my LG G7 for the features;"I bought this for the following to replace my old Sony XZ.
1. Radio -- yes, some of us listen to the radio, but it wasn't a major factor.
2. Audio jack -- bad experience with dongles. Bluetooth don't last if you're on the phone for hours for work. This was a key factor.
3. 2 year limited warranty. This kind of sweetened the deal.

Other reasons to like this:
1. Music. I heard about the audio feature and was majorly impressed compared to my Sony XZ which I replaced this with.

Some things to get used to:
1. Getting used to the new interface coming from a different brand. Not a major issue.
2. Slightly larger than I expected. Cannot simply use my thumb to do one finger typing as much anymore. Oh well.

Overall, I was deciding between the Samsung S9 and the LG G7 ThinQ. I first came across the LG G7 while browsing at Best Buy and noticed the LG G6 on display. After researching more online, I decided on the LG G7 and purchased it online. I haven't regretted this purchase yet!";Wayne Lee;20-Nov-18;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews;radio,jack;1,0

5.0 out of 5 stars;Awsome camera, awesome music.;"So I bought this at B&H with a big discount. It lists $120 less than this one, but it comes with several freebies that make the phone cost around $530ish . Tx&Sh are included. You get a tempered glass screen protector. And you get a pair of earbuds with mic.

Now the phone. I checked this out at T Mobile and was stunned by the screen. Loved the 19.5:9 ratio. It makes the phone bigger than my old one without making it too big. It still has to fit in my front pocket. Screen is so nice and android 8 is nice. The two things I look for in a phone besides calls, text and email is for photos and music.

Camera is very good. (With latest updates it's better than the iphone 7+) Maybe not the very best, but if you aren’t a YouTube reviewer you won’t be comparing it to 10 other phones. Took some videos and really liked them. Cool feature is you can pause the video, but keep it as one video file, just with breaks. It also has separate camera and video record buttons, just like my digital camera. No fumbling with a menu to switch between photo and video. Low light is good. Wide angle is really nice for indoor shots.

Music is a priority to me. I listen to music thru my car speakers all the time. I also need a headphone jack to do this, so that really limited my choices. I’m so glad LG kept the jack. The Quad DAC is awesome!  It does make the music sound better even my car speakers. Boom box is nice, the speaker is very loud, probably the loudest you can get. Bass is absent until you place it on a table. Mids and highs are just fine.

Overall this is perfect for me. No messing with iTunes. I hate iTunes so much I will never buy an iPhone. All I want to do is add music effortlessly. Really just love everything about the phone.

2 month update:
The extended battery option definitely helps with battery life. I’m a light to medium user, so I often go two + days before charging.

Fast charge really is fast. It charges 1% per minute.

Google assistant is actually really cool, when it works. I really didn’t know what this was all about, but am finding that I use it a lot now. It’s just like Alexa, which I use all the time at home. So using this isn’t hard to get use to. The LG G7 has an always on  listening mic so you just say ‘hey google’.

Most will complain about the LG skin on top of android. I actually like some of the features. The floating bar is useful and I use it everyday. I use the LG music player because googles music player is just an ad machine.  No matter what setting I set, google music will eventually start pushing its paid services and music I have no interest in.

Super bright boost screen is actually useful. In broad daylight while wearing sunglasses, I can keep my sunglasses on and still see my screen. I’ve used boost more often than I thought I ever would.

So many unlock methods it’s ridiculous. I use in this order, face unlock, fingerprint unlock, knock code, voice unlock. I am finding that I wish the fingerprint unlock was in the screen instead of behind.

As a phone the size is really nice. Thin, kind of heavy and long. It reminds me of holding a home phone. When holding it up to my ear, the mic extends all the way to my mouth, it feels natural and not like a small toy the way most phones feel.

After several updates the camera is amazing!  Some of the best photos I’ve seen.  With latest updates photos are now better than the iPhone 7+.  I now use my phone for all photos and videos and no longer use my digital camera, the quality is better and overall experience is better, faster and easier than my canon.

Loving this phone!";tech boo;26-Jul-18;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews;screen,camera,lowlight,wideangle,jack,quaddac,sound,boombox,sepaker,battery,size;1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1.0 out of 5 stars;LG does NOT honor their warranties!;"I have now had two experiences with them that were both around their horrible design for SIM card handling.  On the G6, they have such a flimsy SIM card tray that they routinely break and often that is inside the phone...damaging contacts as you try to pull the mangled tray out.  Do a quick search and you will see how many vendors offer replacement trays, and how many users are screwed by the thing breaking inside the phone.  That is then YOUR problem, because it is ""physical damage"", and is not covered by their warranty program.  Add to that the repair policy of it taking 2 weeks to turn your repair around (so yu have no phone) and the result is:

I will NEVER buy another LG phone, and I strongly suggest you also avoid their products!!!!";Larry in FL;20-Aug-18;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews;-;2
2.0 out of 5 stars;Solid build - great screen - poor battery and camera software;Really love the size and build of this device.  The audio was great, the screen was great.  Performance really suffered in that the OS did not seem optimized for the hardware (stutters and lags) but this was most evident in the camera software which would lock up during launch or during a photo capture, sometimes not even taking a photo.  This was also reflecting in the poor battery life, very moderate use in good signal area resulted in 50% drain with only a few hours (mostly in standby).  Wanted to really like this device but it didn't work out.;J. Gibson;1-Feb-19;;size,audio,screen;1,1,1

1.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible privacy policy;"I actually read privacy policies, and this is the scariest one I have ever seen.  Not only does LG reserve the right to take all your information (location, contacts, pictures, videos, email, etc) for their thinQ AI and for Google Assistant, they also reserve the right to force Over-the-air updates which remove features from the phone and cannot be rolled back.  You're paying $730 for LG to potentially spy on you, sell your personal data to everyone else, brick your phone and make you pay more to get it working again.

Pretty much no phone has privacy anymore, but this is the most eggregious violation of decency I've seen yet.  It is pretty though... I wish I could have made it past the ""agree to this privacy policy"" screen to see what else it could have done.";unknown user;22-Sep-18;;screen;2

4.0 out of 5 stars;probably the best phone you can buy for $300 (5/2019);"got mine used, it didn't come with any accessories but I have found no blemishes... I can buy accessories xD

ANYWAY my biggest complaint is it's still on Android 8 Oreo! C'mon LG and this is on Google Fi it's fully endorsed by GOOGLE I did not expect that :/. Android 9 should come but Android 10 is out so... c'mon LG worst support EVER (for a flagship device). 16:9 videos UNDERSTANDABLY don't fill the 18:9 screen (I don't know what I was expecting...).  The camera (though NOT something I know much about) is really not that great... word is due to software overhead (Android 9 where are you??)... but the one shot I took was SO blurry, if I really cared though I could find a better app to use and so on but default it SUCKS (I hear it gets pretty good though...). OK it MIGHT be a little unresponsive of a touchscreen too- I've noticed on my tappy tap tap game it sometimes takes 3 or 4 taps to find the 'hotspot'... I mean maybe it's me but... my history with LG is like this so... it could be the software? I will update when I mod the phone if it is actually a thing... also part is cuz I'm not used to such a small bezel like where does the screen end? so I could be touching the bezel.
That's a short set of negatives on a 300 dollar (400 new) phone though, pluses include WIDESCREEN camera- not that I care about that but it seems to be all the rage, a BOOMIN speaker (just 1 speaker mind you... but I can HEAR IT IN THE SHOWER without bringing it into the actual shower that is LOUD) that's basically a bluetooth speaker, quad dac that makes my $50 100 ohm Yamahas sound like $500 Bose (overpriced but hey! you get the idea- Bose headphones are better quality than their speakers though), super bright screen I can see outside and a great 5+ hour screen on time (basically all day battery).
So with it being SUPER affordable with plus specs AND Google certified (though slow updates :/ I believe they will come eventually) I count 3 negs (not counting the aspect ratio one... that's an android issue really) to 5 positives HIGHLY recomended!";Knowname;12-May-19;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews;camera,touchscreen,speaker,headphones, screen;1,1,1,1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;Best Android phone i've had in my life!;"First of all, my last 2 phones were both iPhones and I chose Android this time because of the compatiblity with other devices. Why LG G7? Every flagship has the same specs, but the sound on this one... perfection!

Pros:

- Sound with and without headphones is great, I don't think if anyone could improve this.
- O.S. dont freezes, actually is the best LG (I repair phones, so I tested every LG that exists, except for the V30).
- AI Cam is great, but it can improve like everything new.

Cons:

- Facial Recognition is a little bit slower.

Great phone!

1.0 out of 5 stars;WARNING!  False Advertising from a dishonest seller;"The phone in and of it self is a good phone, however, it's not the US version (G710ULM) with a US warranty as advertised (3/8/19); it's the international version (G710EM) with no available US warranty.

One way to tell if you've been ripped off is to check the model number in ""Settings/About Phone"".  If you have any other number other than G710ULM, you don't have the US version with a warranty.  If a time comes when you need warranty service, you are sorry out of luck.

I contacted LG directly, provided LG with the IMEI number for the phone, and they confirmed the phone was intended only for in the UK, not for in the USA.  LG also confirmed you cannot get a US warranty for it.

Another way to tell if you've been ripped off is to power off the phone and power it back on.  If you see ""Claro"", and words in another language, you've been ripped off.  ""Claro"" is a carrier in Guatemala, and is what the phone I received booted up with.  Additionally, the phone had ""Claro"" bloatware installed on it, of which couldn't be uninstalled.

Additionally, there are compatibility issues with this phone for US carriers because it's an international version, not a US version.  I have AT&T, and they've informed me phone calls should work, but there may be very slow data speeds because of network conflicts with the international version.  I confirmed this with a data speed tests, and my data speeds were very inconsistant and very slow.";Yeshua's Talmidim;9-Mar-19;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone;1
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not Compatible with Verizon;Did tons of research on what phone to get and after several weeks, decided to go with the G7 because I like the LG format. I double- and triple-checked every phone I looked at to make sure that they were compatible with Verizon as I know ordering any unlocked phone online can be very finicky because of this. The manufacturer and seller both specifically stated in the Q&A section that the phone is compatible with Verizon, so it seems to me that they either don't know their own product or that they just flat-out lied. Such a bummer because I was so excited to set up this phone when I got it. Hopefully this review will be more helpful than the false information I received. Will not be ordering from this seller again.;Jake;16-Jan-19;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone;2
3.0 out of 5 stars;Forget about Using Verizon Visual Voicemail with This Phone;I bought this phone to replace my broken LG G5.

5.0 out of 5 stars;"Legit if it's ""shipped from and sold by Amazon""";Crazy good deal for $400. This display on this phone is beautiful. I'm super happy with it and it's crazy how fast the prices on last year's flagship phones have dropped. Updates on this phone will be below average(Feb 2019 patch at the time of this review), but I knew that going into this purchase and felt that it was worth it to get such good hardware at a mid range price. This phone should get android 9 Pie, probably not Q though. I wish LG was better with the updates and patches but just about any Android phone is gonna be some type of compromise. Performance on this phone is top notch, it has everything you could want- IP68, wireless charging, USB 3.1 data transfer speeds, Snapdragon 845, 3120x1440p display, Dual cameras with video recording on the Ultra wide angle lens, UFS 2.1 flash storage, Super loud speaker, 32 bit quad DAC. If you are into photography then you should side-load the Google Camera app with Night Sight because then you can really maximize the hardwares ability to capture images. All and all, I think this is a solid choice for anyone who wants a solid phone that will last a couple of years but doesn't have 800-1000 to spend on an iPhone XS or Galaxy s10. And once again, this item is a NEW Unlocked LG G7 (G710ULM).;Daniel R;25-May-19;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews;display, price;1,1

2.0 out of 5 stars;Does NOT work on Verizon;"I received my platinum grey Lg G7 ThinQ in the mail yesterday. I bought a case and screen protector and everything, set up all my information and transferred my contacts... then I went to the store today to put it on a data plan and the Verizon gentleman told me it is not compatible. Don't believe the answered questions by the manufacturer that says it's compatible with Verizon. IT IS NOT! I repeat: IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VERIZON.

Also, I was playing around with the camera last night, and the pictures really leave more to be desired. For having one of the highest MP cameras on a phone, the quality is sub-par. If a great camera is something that you want, try a different phone. My friend has a Google Pixel 3, and it takes amazing pictures effortlessly.

Other than that, the phone met functionality expectations which is the only reason why it didn't get a 1. I'm mostly rating it low because this seller is BS, and I don't want them to lie anymore on their description and questions when they're asked which networks this phone is compatible with.";Amazon Customer;7-Mar-19;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews;camera, phone, pictures;1,2,1

2.0 out of 5 stars;First unit arrived defective -- returned, this unit replaced later and seems fine.;Other than defects, which can happen in any brand and model, once we ordered a replacement this product seems to operate fine.  Note that the G7 ThinQ does not have an identical user interface to the LG V35.  G7 is much less intuitive to use or find desired settings and appears to be missing some useful settings or options found on the V35 model.  Quality of materials is excellent and sound quality is above average, though not as good as as the Moto Droid Turbo 2 it replaced (the T2 had dual sizable front-facing stereo speakers).  Given the choice again, now that we know the user interface difference, we would choose the V-series rather than G-series phone.;eNGeeNC;24-Mar-19;;material;1

5.0 out of 5 stars;MUCH Better Than I Expected;"I recently secured a new job and after accepting it, realized rather suddenly that I'm going to have to return my current Samsung S8+ and I'll need another device. I wasn't able to get into what I really wanted (the Note 9) but I did some research and decided to go with the G7. The name, 'ThinQ' is a bit of silly name if you ask me, but oh well. My last LG phone was the G3, which I genuinely liked. I wasn't eligible for the G4 upgrade, and when the G5 modular phone came out, I had made a firm decision not to get it at all (as did most of you). I went with the Galaxy S6+, then the S7 Edge, the S8+ and I was firmly entrenched within the Samsung eco-verse, and fully expected another one was in my future. But that was not to be.

As I mentioned, I did my research and decided to go with the G7. For my budget, it was not just the best phone option, but also, probably the best phone available for that price. It has the internals of the more expensive Samsung rivals, (except only 4gb RAM instead of 6 in the S9+). The screen is almost the exact same size and that within a smaller frame, not a bad trade-off if you ask me.

I was a bit disappointed that LG hadn't fallen in line and upgraded to an OLED screen like even apple has, but I must say, that whatever LG is doing, well keep doing it because the screen is genuinely fantastic. LCD or OLED, this screen is vivid, and amazing. It can get ridiculously bright which makes the screen easily readable in virtually any light. Honestly, I cannot see the difference between it and the Super AMOLED screen on my S8+ if I'm being honest. I almost decided not to go with the LG for the LCD screen alone, but I'm glad I chose to give it a shot anyway. LG hits a home run with the G7 screen. Stunning and beautiful. The one place where OLED beats the LG however is in the deep blacks and how easily it is to save battery life by switching to a screen with more solid blacks. Not an option here, but dang, this screen shouldn't stop you from considering getting the G7 like it did me initially.

The build is top notch...but that only means in order to support wireless charging, it will have to be a bit more vulnerable than phones with all metal backs. It's a trade-off, but worth it if you know the convenience of wireless charging, trust me. Solve this issue by getting a good case that allows for wireless charging and you'll be set.

An honest-to-goodness 3.5mm headphone jack? Right when many are getting rid of them...its a bold move but one I certainly appreciated. The Quad Dac audio player is, especially for a mobile phone, just plain amazing. You're going to hear better audio with this phone, especially with earbuds and headphones than you will with arguably any mobile device out there. I love mine. It's almost worth buying for this alone.

A lot has been made of the cameras, and I found them to be pretty dang good. I don't think you're going to find much to scream about, but in my opinion, I found them to be on par with my Samsung. I haven't experimented much with it yet, but I will and may do a quick update here before too long.

The boom speaker...hmmm. A bit more underwhelming than I expected, especially considering how much LG brags about it. While it certainly gets much louder than my S8+ and I truly appreciated that, is it loud enough that you'd consider using it to watch a movie? Uhhh, no. At least I sure wouldn't. Music sounds better, but just not anywhere as good as I expected considering what I read and saw for the G7 marketing.

USB-C charging, another welcome addition, along with fast charging and wireless charging, too. Once I got used to both of these features, I'm telling you it is quite difficult to go back to something that does not offer this as a standard feature.

The multiple ways to unlock the phone is pretty impressive. You have your standard fingerprint sensor, which is just about a perfect placement since that is where your finger rests naturally most of the time anyway and wasn't LG the first to employ this feature in the first place? You can opt for using a pattern or code or even facial recognition, which I found to be much better than my S8+ and along with that, much faster. It was so unreliable, that I turned it off entirely on the S8.

Gorilla Glass 5 on front and back (I read elsewhere that they used GG 4 on back and 3 on front, but I just confirmed at LG's own site, that was incorrect) help make this very vulnerable looking phone more protected than it looks...but with that said, I still recommend a good case and screen protector (I MUCH prefer glass over the older silicone ones). Regardless of how careful you may be, it isn't a question of if, but when you will accidentally drop it and then you'll find out just how accurate their claims are regarding how tough it may be. Why take that chance? Even if you are super careful, it may be someone else handling your device who drops it--the point is, do yourself a favor and take care of it.

Speed...while it wasn't a huge step up from what I noticed with my S8+, I DID notice how smooth it seemed to be and how much less LG's skin seemed intrusive than it did back when I had the G3. I think this is a move in the right direction. ANY time you can bring a device closer to stock android, is a better move. LG seems to always be in Samsung's shadow and therefore tries to take its own spin on things and the G7 is no exception. Samsung had some fantastic themes that were exclusive to their devices and I found out the other day, the G7 has some to choose from as well. Nowhere near as many, mind you, but some were actually pretty decent...but I'd sacrifice it all for stock android.

And finally...that notch. Ever since the iPhone X came out with that notch, it seemed that you either were okay with it, or you hated it. Not many in betweeners.  Say what you want about it, but if you want more screen real estate, you have 2 options, either place the camera somewhere other than on the front of the screen (some have a novel, mechanical pop-up camera) or you place it on front and work around it somehow. LG embraced this and you have the option of getting rid of it, or keeping it. I find that for most things, it simply doesn't bother me, which I found to be a surprise considering before I got it, I really thought it would bug me silly. But nope. You may be different however, which is why the option to remove it entirely is a nice touch.

The dedicated Google Now button is an almost direct ripoff of Samsung's Bixby button...except that Google Now is actually useful unlike Bixby, which most users simply turn off. It can do almost anything Google can do--just a whole lot slower. Sure, it has a few features that Google Now and Siri cannot do, but they are so slow, you may as well just do it by hand yourself. The other issue is that like Bixby, this button activates Google and nothing else. You cannot remap it to open other things that may also be super convenient for you like say the camera, or the phone etc. LG, if you want to take a leap ahead of Samsung, you're going to need to have the courage to make the decisions that Samsung refuses to do. Just sayin'.

All in all, a very underrated phone that may be hampered a bit due to LG's inability to market their devices with any kind of genuine success...which is too bad. This phone is exceptional and the equal to almost any device out there today.";Jeff Edwards;26-Dec-18;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-ThinQ-Factory-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07DYPM1XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone;2

I can pick up calls in my basement that other phones have issues with.  I got the ATT version and am using it on TMOBILE.  I dont mind the ATT stuff on the phone. BUT OMG,  I hate the FB app . gonna have to remove it with ADB.

I recommend this phone.  I like it cause it is wider than the G7. and has 6 gigs or Ram instead of 4. My laptop only has 4 geesh.

It doesnt come wiht a Wireless charger so BUY ONE.  I LOVE WIRELESS CHARGING NOW!!!!.

Pictures are very good.  but I can only compare it to my old phone. They are better than the Honor or the S7.

Ok the weak spot.  Just one speaker and its not all that loud.  For me No problem.

Would I but again.  YES.  But ask me again after a year of use.

3.0 out of 5 stars;"**Update** T-Mobile problem arose. Not a T-Mobile as seller promised **""";"Seller assured me in writing it was fully T-Mobile compatible. I even paid extra for that. Even had a T-Mobile sticker placed over ATT sticker

1st problem - Booted up with ATT Logo.

2nd problem - I had to delete or shut off as much ATT CRAP that I could find.

3rd Problem - Does not support WiFi Calling, at all!

Called T-Mobile and spoke an engineer.  Phone can't be made compatible. Hardware chipset for WiFi Calling is designed specificly for ATT. CAN'T be modified.  Don't take my word for it. Try if you want. Just giving honest and technically accurate feedback.

Buyer beware if you have T-Mobile.

The reviews on this I e were good...i spent more than i had origionally planned but everyone said great phone for $350 Which when I dont have to make payments on a phone is actually a good price...they werent wrong! I'm not used to the speed or the capacity of what it can do! I have been using the battery a lot just caise i cant put it down.  The only thibg i dont love is I couldnt immediatly figure out how to turn off the data. And use my Wi-Fi instead..but once I figured that out (the next day) I havent had issues.  Also it takes a nano SIM card so i litterally went to AT&T with old and new phone and they took care of SIM card and phone transfer all done in 10 min. Was happy!

5.0 out of 5 stars;Fantastic phone for the money!;"I bought this device to activate on Straight Talk GSM, and as advertised, this product is unlocked. AT&T's bloatware is relatively unintrusive, and after cleanup it doesn't take up much of the device's internal storage.

With that said, it's an excellent phone with few compromises.

Overall, the LG V35's build quality is excellent. Beautiful glass exterior with a stylish design reminiscent of a Galaxy S9+. It feels great in the hand, even with a bulky impact case on. The 1440p OLED screen is fantastic as well. It's nearly as good as a Samsung panel.

Performance-wise, this device is quite snappy. The Snapdragon 845 and 6GB of RAM make multitasking a breeze, and there is no lag in LG's stock ROM at all, even with all the apps I have installed. The LTE modem delivers outstanding performance, as does the Wi-Fi modem. I've never been able to get 70mbps download over LTE in my back yard, but now I can.

The camera is great as well. The rear cameras take great still shots, and the front camera is more than adequate for Snapchat. Video is also quite good. The images are very vivid and crisp.

Battery life is acceptable, and it isn't really a problem if you have the included Fast Charge brick on hand.

Audio is also pretty good. It comes with a high-quality DAC for 3.5mm headphone audio playback, which sounds excellent. The mono speaker is decent for voice calls and talk shows, but is pretty shrill for music.

It does come with AT&T-specific features like Visual Voicemail, voice over LTE, and WiFi calling, but I have yet to get them working on Straight Talk.

My only concern is software updates. The included software is pretty good, but the security patches only reach November 2018, and LG is notorious for being slow with software updates. If you absolutely need up to date security patches, beware.

I would normally expect a phone like this to cost $700, and even then it's a reasonable price, especially if you're an AT&T customer. However, it's only $350, and it is an excellent deal. Would recommend.";Rich G;31-May-19;https://www.amazon.com/LG-ThinQ-Unlocked-Phone-Camera/product-reviews/B07DQ8JGJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,glass,screen,software,device,price;1,1,1,1,2,1

3.0 out of 5 stars;Buyer beware!;I have had LG phones for a while now. I've Loved LG phones I've bragged about LG phones I had the LG 3 and the LG 6 they both lasted Way Beyond the two-year commitment. The cameras on both of those phones we're awesome. When you took a picture it was the color of the item you were taking a picture of. The colors are so off you don't even want to save the picture. For me a great camera on a phone is very important I take pictures of my craft items to sell now I'm going to have to buy a camera where I didn't have to do that before. Also we have a dead zone down the road that we drive through my daughter has had issues going through that dead zone for years with her Samsung even with Verizon. I never had a problem going through the dead zone when I had the LG 3 or the LG 6 now I drop calls just like everybody else in the family. Also I have issues with the GPS I did a trip in 2017 going through eight states and depended on the GPS system and never had a problem going through mountain towns and areas where I questioned losing service but never did with the LG 6. This phone loses its GPS tracking system on a regular basis staying within 50 miles of my house. I would never chance taking a trip with this phone. I did not buy this off of Amazon this was a free phone given to us for switching to AT&T. When I had the LG G3 and LG G6 we had Verizon awesome carrier love them miss them. So I don't know if it is AT&T coverage or if it's the phone but I need to write a review on it so if these things that I have dealt with are important to someone else they might want to look for another phone.;Amazon Customer;25-May-19;https://www.amazon.com/LG-ThinQ-Unlocked-Phone-Camera/product-reviews/B07DQ8JGJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone,camera;1,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;Flagship components at a budget price;"I looked over a lot of phones looking for a replacement aging nexus 6, pocophone looked good but has questionable carrier compatibility and a lot of other unlocked phones in the >$300-400 range.  All the budget phones had some serious down side, missing some key feature or just a low spec components.  Then I stumbled on to the LG V35 and specs were on par with much pricier phones, the screen is oled witch I prefer and better than 1080, had expandable memory, cameras very good, battery hold charge for a long time. I was a little worried about LG as had bad experience with nexus 5x in the past, but looking at the reviews those issues were resolved. I also looked at the V40, but not a fan of the notch, and it is more money with similar specs. So my opinion is this is the best phone for the money right now, yes its been released a year ago, but compared to current phones in the price range V35 beats them no question. It is odd that this phone is not more popular, I guess at release $900 price tag scared people and then it faded out of the spotlight.

What I did not like: I am coming from a 6 inch phone the older wider screen, this screen is a little narrower. It is still good size, length wise about the same. When watching youtube vertically feels like a smaller screen. It is a little less bright than my old phone, could be a good thing as nexus was too bright at lowest setting when using at night. Coming off of stock android, I don't like LG and ATT bloatware and skins. The shareware is not a deal breaker, nothing that can't be worked around, but thought I mention it.

So I'm happy with the purchase and with the better components this phone should last me for a while, highly recommend this phone.";Igor;4-Jun-19;;spec,phone,phone,memory,camera,screen,phone;0,2,0,1,1,0,1

5.0 out of 5 stars;Best LG Yet!!;I've gradually worked my way up in the LG world, from G3 to V40 and I think the V40 is the top of the line LG that is available. I personally think it works so much better than both the Samsung and iPhone that were realeased around the same time. In fact, iPhone has copied LG's knock awake feature, even if they dont call it that. The battery life is phenominal, even with heavy use, I'm not constantly having to plug my phone in throughout the day. On an average day, I dont have to plug it in at all, on a heavy day, just once. I haven't played with all of the cameras yet, but the regular camera's take such sharp, clear photos that I have been having so much fun taking pictures of everyday things and then sharing them.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Great phone with good cameras;Unlike the other reviewer (who posted negative reviews on B&H and Amazon) I will tell you honestly that this is a quality phone with five good, working cameras. If all of the cameras were blurry as he says, this issue would be all over Reddit and the tech sites. It's far more logical to believe that the reviewer is upset he dropped his phone, tried to take pictures though cracked lenses, then chose to lash out at LG because he couldn't return the phone and blamed them for his own stupidity. Is this phone worth $949 or more? No. But if you buy it for $749, it is a solid flagship with decent cameras and a headphone jack.

One, all 5 cameras are bad, all are blurry, out of focus, over sharpened, over saturated, bad quality images, the zoom lens, blurry and awful, the main, blurry and over sharpened, and the wide,  over saturated and over sharpened. Also minor drops from like 2 feet off the ground will crack your phone, this phone is very fragile as i have discovered. So I wouldn't buy this for the cameras, or for durability.

2.0 out of 5 stars;Lack of updates;"Anyone can make a decent phone these days. Hardware wise this is a well balanced smartphone that could use a slightly bigger capacity battery but overall I really have no complaints regarding the performance of this phone from a hardware point of view. My biggest issue is LG's notorious lack of software updates. Last year LG created their Global Software Upgrade Center and promised more timely security updates and major software upgrades for their phones. I was stupid enough to believe them. This phone came with Android 8.1.0 2 months after Android 9 was available. It is now June of 2019 and my ""flagship"" phone is still running Android 8.1.0. What is even worse is it currently has January 1st 2019 security updates. That's right, not a typo.

If you buy this phone, buy it not expecting any updates. If you are OK with that I would still wait till the price drops to around $400-$450 range.  Not only this will be my last LG product I will ever buy but I also will never again spend more than $500 on a phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars;10-Oct;"This is a solid phone. It has so many customizable options and they really thought of everything. It's fast. The speaker is LOUD and the cameras work very well. The screen is beautiful and it feels like a high quality phone.
I didn't want to upgrade from my V20 and I didn't think I'd like this phone, but it's great.";Ron;27-Mar-19;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-Factory-Unlocked-Phone/product-reviews/B07HXS5XSH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone, speaker, camera, screen, quality;1,1,1,1,1

1.0 out of 5 stars;Great phone. Cracks easy.;"Super fast phone and love the camera or should I say cameras. Only downside to it is you may want to consider a charge case if you expect it to last a full day on one charge. Edit.. I dropped it once from less than waist height and it cracked the screen from one side to the other . I have a charge case on it that isn't the best protective case. So be sure to get a very good case not the charge case. LG made this phone with the glass all the way to the edge of the phone and it's not even part of the visible screen. That just makes it easier to damage. Even though I didn't have the best case it still shouldn't have cracked so easy on the first fall from such a low
height. Great phone just fragile. Edit... just called LG and a few other companies.. $270 screen replacement.. I can't stress enough how easily this phone cracked.";Christopher Alex;29-Dec-18;;phone, camera, screen, case;1,1,0,1
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great wired headphone audio quality;"Looks and design: The LG V40 looks fine and similar to most other top-of-the-line smart phones. The LG is light for its size and has very slim bezels. 6.25"" (H) x 2.98"" (W) x 0.31"" (D), Weight: 5.96 oz. I can hold the phone comfortably in one small hand. You can use a micro-SD card up to 2 TB. I highly desire that expansion card. It has a USB-C jack and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Again, I strongly prefer a headphone jack to an additional wire adaptor. In my experience, the adaptor wire often fails in short order or works poorly. There’s a haptic engine that vibrates for feedback.

Durability: The LG is extremely durable, according to its test ratings. It has been drop-tested and passes military standards (MIL-STD-810G). It’s also water and dust-resistant (IP68). It has Gorilla Glass 5 on front, back, and camera. It uses a heat pipe to prevent processor overheating. (Even with these exceptional durability standards, I think all phones should have a case and screen-protector to insure their protection and longevity.) This phone offers a 1-year warranty and register for a free second year of warranty.

Display: The LG 6.4” QHD+ OLED display is great (3120 x 1440, 538 ppi). For phones, like most people, I prefer OLED in general. This display technology gives outstanding contrast, vivid color, great battery efficiency, and is VR-ready. I think the best Samsung screens are slightly better when comparing side-by-side, but the difference in quality is not large to me.  I really like the big screen real-estate that this phone offers (6.4” screen with 84.3% screen-to-body ratio), because one of my primary uses of the phone is as an electronic reader.

You get a nice always-on (when you want it to be, adjustable) display. This display is customizable. I have mine display a jpg along with time, day, date, and battery level. I really like that. As is the custom lately, it has a notch for the front camera (apx. 0.25”), where they put useful info like time, battery level, cell reception strength, wireless network, etc. I like that too.

I understand that upscaling is offered in phones, but sometimes that doesn’t work great. Observing the default settings on each flagship phone in a store, I loved the size of icons and text on the LG. The icons on the Apple were pretty, but I liked the text on the LG better. The icons and text were vibrant and clear on the Samsung, but the default size (I did not adjust any of them) of the text was smaller than I prefer. These judgments are with the phone properly positioned.

My eyes are very sensitive to glare, so I use an ArmorSuit anti-glare protection screen. I can see this phone and read information outside, albeit with some difficulty in bright conditions. Personally, I’ve never seen a phone that completely satisfied me for this purpose. In contrast, the Amazon Kindle paper white ink display is great for viewing in the bright outdoors.

Headphone sound: Headphone sound is extremely important to me, as one of my primary uses of my phone is as a FLAC music player. For wired headphones, the LG V40 is the only smartphone I’ve heard (currently available) that provides me the sound quality that I demand. The amplifier is adequate for easy to drive IEMs. The Fiio X7 has a more powerful amp. Testing was done with the 64Audio A6 custom IEMs (worth much more than the phone) and customized JetAudio Plus. These IEMs should be easy for an amp to power - Sensitivity: 115dB/mW; 22 ohm impedance. For those who want Bluetooth, the LG V40 has version 5.0 and supports many profiles.

Speaker sound: The LG V40 speaker sound is tolerable. It is vastly inferior in volume to the ZTE Axon 7 (which has 2 front-facing speakers). So, while most people can easily hear phone conversations, using it as a speaker phone in a teleconference may not work well.

Reception: The LG V40 receives a great variety of signals, 4, WiFi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth V. 5, mobile hotspot, wi-fi direct, USB and Bluetooth tethering, NFC, media serve, screen sharing, MIDI device, mirror link, S-PGS, and A-GPS.

I’m not sure of its antennae range in objective measures. If you find it inadequate and can’t use wi-fi, then you will have to find and purchase a signal booster.

This phone seems to have no problem connecting to wi-fi networks that require a password. At least, it had no problem connecting to my home wi-fi network. I have had trouble connecting to some free wi-fi networks using this phone. Sometimes, it works and sometimes it doesn’t. While this is no big deal to me (cellular towers still work), it is unacceptable for a flagship phone, and I deduct a star from its rating because of that.

No IR blaster; so, the phone can’t be used as a remote control in some situations.

Camera: The LG V40 camera provides adequate quality for people who just want to point and shoot. If that is your gig, then flagships from Samsung, Apple, and Google will often provide better pictures. If you are willing to shoot pictures in RAW and process the pics on your computer using Adobe or DxO on your computer, then your LG V40 should routinely give very good results. Furthermore, the LG has excellent manual controls available to allow even better pics if you know the proper settings.

The lenses seem to be at least of reasonable quality. I don’t know why LG did not have DxO test the quality. That makes me suspicious.

What I like most about the camera is the versatility that it offers. If you can’t get close enough, use telephoto. If you need a wider view to get everything in the picture, use wide-angle lens (also available for selfies). And of course, there is the standard lens. That’s basically 5 lenses (2 in front and 3 in back) on this camera, allowing excellent versatility. I approve!

Video: Video is actually better than photos at capturing a moment, even if the videos are short, because they include action and sound as well as picture. Overall, the LG V40 does well as a video recorder.

4K Video Recording at 60 FPS. Steady Record helps smooth videos. HDR10 video recording looks good. You can point and zoom at any selected area on the screen. You can do things manually or automatic, with different cinema effects available. You can record slo-mo or create time lapse. With the video studio, you can merge photos and add titles and background music. This phone was made to be an outlet of your creative abilities. Personally, I like that I can get quality recordings with it. I will do the processing and creation on my computer, using special purpose software.

Expect the audio of your recording to be among the best in smartphones.

OS and updates: The LG V40 comes with Oreo (Android 8.1). Its interface is decent. However, I elected to use Nova Launcher and AnySoftKeyboard. I am able to customize the display to be pleasing to me. There is a hard button available for Google Assistant (Siri substitute). It works well.

Apple and Google are excellent with updating the OS on their phones. LG is more mediocre in that arena.

CPU: LG V40 offers near top-of-the-line CPU and GPU. This phone is very fast, and I had no problems with multiple programs running. It uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 and Adreno 630 with 6 GB RAM and 64 GB storage with optional storage in the micro-SD card.

Security: LG V40 security is great. The fingerprint scanner has always been a gripe among smartphones, and this one works well and is well positioned. Other less secure options for unlocking the phone are also available. It has face recognition, but this feature is not as good as Apple.

Battery-life and recharging: LG V40 battery-life is OK. It will last a day for me with a lot of music and e-pub reading. It may not fare so well if you game for hours, but it is rated to be adequate or average by most professional reviews. It has plenty of excellent charging options: USB Type-C port, wireless charging, and Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0.

Accessories: Apple and Samsung command the lion’s share of the market in the USA and internationally; likewise, they have the biggest line of accessories. Still, LG is a big company, and some quality manufacturers will supply accessories for LG’s phones.

Customer service: I’m not sure of the quality of LG’s customer service. It is a giant corporation, so at least it won’t be going out of business. LG does have a massive presence in the USA. So, I would hope there would be a strong base for customer support with English speaking staff. You do get a 2-year warranty (upon registration).

Overall: With my insistence on great audio and storage, this is the best smartphone for me, albeit expensive. Samsung Galaxy S9 or S10 and Galaxy Note 9, Apple iPhone Xs, and Google Pixel 3 are solid options if great audio with wire headphones is not a requirement for you (or you are less demanding than me) – and your pockets are deep.";RONNIE J BEVER JR;25-Feb-19;https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-Factory-Unlocked-Phone/product-reviews/B07HXS5XSH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews;phone, headphone jack,camera, display, battery, screen, sound, headphone, audio, smartphone;1,2,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1
